This repository contains the [Octopus.com/blog](https://octopus.com/blog/) posts.

Read the following pages to learn about the [markdown syntax](conventions.md) we use on the blog, read the [writing tips](tips.md) to get a sense of the style and tone we're aiming for, and grab a [template](templates/readme.md) to get started.

Internal authors can create a branch to do their work in, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (i.e., 2020-01/), find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out and add your files there. 

When you're happy with your post and think it's ready to be reviewed, create a PR and assign @robpearson and @wordlee as reviewers.

If you're drafting a post that you'd like to keep private until it's published, use the [internal blog drafts repo](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/internal-blog-drafts).
