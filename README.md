# Octopus blog

The Octopus blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that demonstrate our domain expertise.

This repository contains the [Octopus.com/blog](https://octopus.com/blog/) posts.

Authors must sign the [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OctopusDeploy/docs) before we can accept your contribution.

The repo includes [templates](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/tree/master/templates) to help you get started.

# How to submit a blog post 

Internal authors can create a branch for their work, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (i.e., 2023-01/). Find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out and add your files there. 

If you'd like feedback on a work in progress, create a draft PR and tag @TeganAli with your request.

When you're happy with your post and it's ready to be reviewed, please create a PR. Go through the checklist on the PR template, assign @TeganAli as reviewer, and drop a note in Slack in #topic-content-marketing. (No need to fill out a content brief.)

When submitting your post in #topic-content-marketing, you also need to provide copy for a Twitter post **and** LinkedIn post to promote your blog post in **#topic-social-media**. (The marketing team will edit and post these on social media.) 

- Please make sure your tweet is no more than 280 characters, including spaces and the link to the blog post. 
- LinkedIn posts have a 3000-character limit, so you can include more detail, but still keep it brief. 
- Please refer to our [writing tips for social media](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2608464184/Writing+tips+for+social+media) before writing your social posts. 
- Please also check the copy using Grammarly (Octopus has a corporate license) and the [Hemingway app](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to remove typos, grammatical errors, and passive voice.
- Submit your social posts in #topic-social-media.

If you're drafting a post that you'd like to keep private until it's published, use the [internal blog drafts repo](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/internal-blog-drafts).

The editing process takes time and we have a schedule of posts, so giving us at least 2 weeks notice is preferred and appreciated. For time-sensitive posts, we'll do our best to get the post published as soon as possible. Please consider that the design team also needs time to create a blog image.
