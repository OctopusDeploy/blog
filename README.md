# How to submit a blog post 

Internal authors can create a branch for their work, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (i.e., 2020-01/). Find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out and add your files there. 

If you'd like feedback on a work in progress, create a draft PR and tag @TeganAli with your request.

When you're happy with your post and think it's ready to be reviewed, create a PR, assign @TeganAli as reviewer, and drop a note in Slack in #topic-content-marketing.

If you're drafting a post that you'd like to keep private until it's published, use the [internal blog drafts repo](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/internal-blog-drafts).
