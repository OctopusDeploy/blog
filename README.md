# Octopus blog

The Octopus blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that demonstrate our domain expertise.

This repository contains the [Octopus.com/blog](https://octopus.com/blog/) posts.

Authors must sign the [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OctopusDeploy/docs) before we can accept your contribution.

The repo includes [templates](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/tree/master/templates) to help you get started.

You should also read our note on why [we don't use generated content on our websites](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2623767318).

You'll also find some helpful links and information on the [PR template](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md#before-you-submit-your-post).

If you're drafting a post that you need to keep private until it's ready for review, use the [internal blog drafts repo](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/internal-blog-drafts). Transfer it to the public repo when it's ready for review.

# How to submit a blog post 

For specific instructions, please see the section on [creating a new branch, pull request, and blog post in Confluence](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2828959895/Managing+the+blog#Creating-a-new-branch%2C-pull-request%2C-and-blog-post).

Internal authors can create a branch for their work, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (e.g., 2025-01/). Find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out and add your files there. 

When you're happy with your post, please create a PR. Go through the checklist on the [PR template](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) and complete all the steps before you assign @TeganAli as reviewer. When ready, please drop a note in Slack in #topic-content-marketing. (No need to fill out a content brief.)

The editing process takes time, and we have a schedule of posts, so giving us at least one week's notice is preferred and appreciated. For time-sensitive posts, we'll do our best to get the post published as soon as possible. Please consider that the design team also needs time to create a blog image.

(If you're feeling unsure about your content and would like feedback on a work in progress, you can create a draft PR and tag @TeganAli with your request, however she'll do a full review and edit when the post is submitted as a PR and she's assigned as a reviewer.)
