# Octopus blog

The Octopus blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that demonstrate our domain expertise.

This repository contains the [Octopus.com/blog](https://octopus.com/blog/) posts.

Authors must sign the [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OctopusDeploy/docs) before we can accept your contribution.

The repo includes [templates](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/tree/master/templates) to help you get started.

## How to submit a blog post

For detailed instructions, please see the section on [creating a new branch, pull request, and blog post in Confluence](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2828959895/Managing+the+blog#Creating-a-new-branch%2C-pull-request%2C-and-blog-post).

Internal authors can create a branch for their work, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (e.g., 2025-01/). Find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out, and add your files there.

When you're happy with your post, please create a PR. Go through the checklist on the [PR template](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/blog/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) and complete all the steps. When ready, please drop a note in Slack in #website-requests.

Please allow a week for scheduling.
