At Octopus Deploy, we are passionate about automation, be it code, databases, or infrastructure, which is why we are excited to announce that we are sponsoring [DevOps Days London](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-london/welcome/) on September 26-27, 2019 at the QEII Centre in Westminster, London, UK.

DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community-run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from the community, for the benefit of the community. 

The format of DevOpsDays London includes a single track of 30-minute talks in the morning of each event, followed by Ignite talks (5 minutes, auto-forwarding). We spend the rest of the afternoon in Open Spaces, which are considered a vital portion of the event and will give us the chance to speak with Octopus users.

There is still time to register!  You can use the code _**DODL19_OCTOPUS20**_ to get a 20% discount, and you can register [here](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-london/registration/).

If youâ€™re already coming, be sure to say hi to the team, and grab some stickers. We have some Octopus T-Shirts to give away too, so get in early!
