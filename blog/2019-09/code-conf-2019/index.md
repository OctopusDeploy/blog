** IMAGE PENDING

At Octopus Deploy, we are passionate about getting out and talking with customers and giving back to the community, Which is why we are excited to announce that we are going to and sponsoring [Code Conf](https://www.code-conf.com/2019/code-conf/) on October 28, 2019 at the QDI - Danish Industry, H.C. Andersens Boulevard 18, Copenhagen, Denmark.

CoDe-Conf will return to Copenhagen for the 6th year and it promises to be bigger and better than ever. CoDe-Conf 2019 will bring together everyone in the DevOps ecosystem - from executives and managers to engineers and programmers.

Continuous Delivery and DevOps are about culture and tools, so this year’s CoDe-Conf will feature two tracks. One track will focus on culture and change, and the second one will focus on tech and tools. There will be something for everyone!

There is still time to register!  We have a few discounted tickets that we can share with customers and to get this code, please email <Advice@Octopus.com> mentioning Code Conf. Don't hesitate as we only have a few discounted tickets at 25% and once they are gone, they are gone! You can register [here](https://www.code-conf.com/2019/code-conf/#tickets)

If you're already coming, then be sure to say hi to the team, grab some stickers, and we have some Octopus T-Shirts to give away to, so get in early!
