![Introduction to HCL and HCL tooling](blogimage-config-as-code-explanation_2020.png)

[Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) is a unique configuration language. Intended for use with the Hashicorp set of tools, notably Terraform, HCL has expanded as a more general configuration language. HCL is visually similar to JSON with additional data structures and capabilities built-in.

HCL consists of three sub-languages, structural, expression, and templates. When combined together, the sub-languages form a well structured HCL configuration file. Motivating this structure is the need to accurately and easily describe environmental configurations necessary for the Terraform tool.

Recently, HCL has migrated away from using Version 1 of the language in favor of Version 2. This article assumes we are talking about HCL2 instead of HCL1. HCL2 is a combination of HCL and the HashiCorp Interpolation Language (HIL). HIL adds string interpolation and greater ability to use functions in variable declarations.

With all this talk of Terraform does this imply that HCL cannot or should not be used with other tools? Absolutely not! Over time different parsers have become available, such as Go, Java, and Python. In this article, we talk about how to get started using HCL and what tools exist to take advantage of its unique features.

## The HCL language and features

HCL is a JSON compatible language that adds features to help you use the Terraform tool to its highest potential. These features make HCL a [powerful configuration language](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/hclsyntax/spec.md) in its own right and help fix some of the shortcomings of JSON itself.

- Comments are available as single line or multi-line
    - Single Line: `#` or `//`.
    - Multi-Line: `/* */` (no nesting of block comments).
- Variable assignments use the `key = value` construction where whitespace does not matter and the value can be a primitive such as a string, number, boolean, object, or a list.
- Strings are quoted and can contain any UTF-8 characters.
- Numbers can be written and parsed in a number of different ways:
    - Base 10 numbers are the default.
    - Hexadecimal: Prefix a number with `0x`.
    - Octal: Prefix a number with a `0`.
    - Scientific Numbers: Use the notation such as `1e10`.
- Arrays and lists of objects are easy to create using `[]` for arrays and `{ key = value }` for lists.

This short overview is merely scratching the surface of what HCL can do. It is much easier to see how HCL works in practice by exploring an example configuration file and analyzing how it works.

## Create a simple HCL configuration file

To best understand what an HCL configuration actually looks like, let's create a simple configuration that demonstrates a few of the features available within:

```bash
/*
Define the default configuration values here
*/
default_address = "127.0.0.1"
default_message = upper("Incident: ${incident}")
default_options = {
  priority: "High",
  color: "Red"
}

incident_rules {
	# Rule number 1
	rule "down_server" "infrastructure" {
		incident = 100
		options  = var.override_options ? var.override_options : var.default_options
		server   = default_address
		message  = default_message
	}
}
```

You may notice right away that we are using a function call and string interpolation for the `default_message` variable. The `upper()` function will make a string uppercase, while using the `${}` construct replaces the variables inside it with their values in a given string.

Another feature that may look odd, relative to other configuration languages, is the `rule "down_server" "infrastructure"` format. This is a `type label label` format. In this example, we are defining the rule type and the rule category for use in our application.

Finally, in this demonstration, you will see that we use a ternary conditional for the `options` variable. If the `override_options` variable exists we use that value, otherwise we fall back to using the `default_options`. This configuration demonstrates the powerful ability for HCL to take advantage of logic, string interpolation, and operations from within the language itself.

## Editing HCL configurations easily

There are many editors out there, but one of the most popular right now is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offered for free by Microsoft. VS Code offers extensions that add additional functionality to the base editor. An [HCL extension exists](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wholroyd.HCL) to offer proper language colorization.

Another VS code extension is the [Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=4ops.terraform) that also adds HCL support, despite being named for one of the Hashicorp tools. This extension offers syntax highlighting and basic validation.

The [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) offers an [HCL syntax highlighting](https://atom.io/packages/language-hcl) package as well. This is an alternative editor to VS Code which is also popular among developers.

## HCL processing and tooling in other languages

Up to this point, I've talked about using HCL in the context of the Hashicorp set of tools, but there are other tooling that can consume a HCL file for use in different applications. For example the [hclq command-line processor](https://hclq.sh/). This command-line processor offers the following features.

- Inspection and validation of configurations.
- An alternative to parsing files with `grep` or `sed`.
- Preprocessing for value interpolation.

One caveat is that this tool does not currently have HCL2 support but it is planned.

As many organizations are now larger users of the Go programming language, it may be an attractive option to use HCL in a Go program. There is a [Go package](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/hcl) that can decode HCL into usable Go structures.

This module consumes the HCL configuration and decodes the input into an abstract syntax tree (AST) that enables easy manipulation of the configuration from within Go. Integrating HCL2 into server-side Go programs allow you to use complex configurations that are easy to understand.

For Python, there is an [HCL2 parser](https://pypi.org/project/python-hcl2/) that does not support HCL1 but for most projects, this is not necessary. Built using Lark, a parsing toolkit, Python HCL2 makes it easy to integrate an HCL2 configuration into any Python project.

## How HCL can help your application

The Hashicorp Configuration Language is a unique configuration language that may have started out specific to Hashicorp but has since evolved to become more attractive in a variety of projects. The recent HCL2 rewrite to further incorporate string interpolation and additional functions increases the usability of an already flexible language. The power of a configuration language that is easy to understand with built-in templating, is quickly making HCL2 the language of choice for complex configurations.
