This post is the next [in our series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/At%20The%20Helm) chatting to people at Octopus about their role, what they’re working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Harsh Sabikhi, Senior Vice President, Revenue.

## You have an impressive track record working at DevOps companies. Can you tell us a little about your career before Octopus?

Prior to joining Octopus, I have spent my career following the evolution of software development from Waterfall to Agile to DevOps at PTC, Rally Software, GitHub, and HashiCorp.

## Why did you join Octopus Deploy?

Throughout my career, I have spent a lot of time in the development phase.  At HashiCorp, I was exposed to the operations side but from an infrastructure perspective.  One common theme I noticed was deploying to production was never trivial.  Operations teams would and still have release windows that are at 6 PM on a Saturday.  Octopus Deploy is helping organizations remove that friction by allowing them to deploy whenever, wherever.

## What are your responsibilities as Senior Vice President, Revenue? 

I am responsible for our entire Go-to-Market strategy from a revenue perspective which includes Sales, Solutions Engineering, Sales Development, Customer Success, Professional Services, and Technical Account Management. Ultimately, we are responsible for for ensuring our customers have a great experience when they interact with Octopus either pre-sales or post-sales.

## How are you delivering value and improving the sales experience for our customers?

We are first structuring the organization into a Named Account model for the Enterprise segment (>2500 employees) where each customer will have a dedicated Account Executive. They will be the main point of contact from a pre-sales perspective.  If it is an existing account, they will also have a Customer Success Manager (CSM) as a post-sales contact.  The next thing we are doing is helping to improve the self-service experience by allowing free trials and purchase Octopus directly from octopus.com.  Finally, we are investing in our channel partners and allowing them to resell Octopus as well as partnering with Amazon and Microsoft so our customers can purchase Octopus directly from their respective marketplaces. 

## How do you motivate your team?

I try to lead by example and lead from the front.  I just got back after being on the road for 3 weeks visiting numerous customers and partners.  I love going on calls with my team and it doesn’t matter where the customer is in the sales cycle, I try to get involved.

## What’s something surprising people might not know about you?

That I am actually an Electrical Engineer by education and was a software developer for 6 years before moving into sales!
