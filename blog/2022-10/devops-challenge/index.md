# DevOps Challenge

**Challenge Topic**: DevOps

**Challenge Goal**: Create a working website that is deployed to the cloud and can be deployed automatically. 

**Challenge Outcome**: Build your application building, build, and deployment skills. 

**Challenge Deadline**: _*2months from release date*_

## Prerequisites: 

* [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Free GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
* [Free Octopus Deploy Account](https://octopus.com/start?utm_campaign=octopuschallenge&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=sarah)
* [A text editor like Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Challenge Overview: 

Build a website that has one of three purposes: 

* Allows the end user to query weather forecasts
* Show off your resume
* Allows the end user to interact with one of the Azure Cognitive Services, maybe upload an image and get the analysis back, for example. 

You can use any coding language that you wish to complete this website.  Please think about security, CSS styling, and coding best practices while working on it. 

The website should be deployed to an appropriate Azure service, Azure Web Apps, Azure Static Web Apps, or maybe you want to try containerizing your website and application and deploying it that way! Choose whichever option you think is best. 

Once the website code is built and running locally on your machine, build your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub & Octopus Deploy. 

GitHub is great for storing code and building your application; Octopus Deploy integrates great with GitHub and can help you with the deployment of your application. 

Once you have completed that step, we’d like you to write a blog post on your challenge experience.  If you don’t already have a blog, you can set one up on [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [The Ops Community](https://community.ops.io/). 

The goal of the blog post is for you to document your solution. Here are some things I’d recommend, including:
* Why did you take on the challenge?
* How long did the challenge take you to complete?
* How did you complete the challenge? Include screenshots, diagrams, code snippets, links, and anything you’d like.
* Which was the most challenging part?
* What part of the challenge did you enjoy the most?
* What are your biggest takeaways?

## When you are finished

You can complete this project yourself or in collaboration with others.  Feel free to ask questions in our [Slack server](https://octopus.com/slack) (there’s a specific channel for this challenge). 

When you have completed the project, post a link to your blog post in the Slack challenge; also, share a link to your LinkedIn Profile.  This will enable me to connect with you and endorse you on the skills you have demonstrated in this project: Azure, CI/CD, Octopus Deploy, and the programming language you used.

This challenge is open indefinitely however, those that enter before the DATE TBC will be entered into a prize draw to win some cool Octopus Deploy swag!
