DevOps has brought the topic of organization culture firmly to the table.

- Westrum Organization Culture - categorizes organizations into one of three culture types
- Work to rule - the rise of the term *quiet quitting* to refer to workers reaction to authoritative cultures
- The Great Resignation / Reshuffle - which saw a mass exodus of talent in 2021 as people demanded a better work-life balance, more flexibility, and improved pay

The fundamental assumption that drives culture was described by Douglas McGregor in his 1960 book, *The Human Side of Enterprise*. An organization either believes:

- That people are motivated by rewards and punishments, or
- That people are intrinsically motivated to do good work

McGregor referred to the first assumption as "Theory X", the prevailing management theory at the time and still common today. The second assumption is "Theory Y" and underpins modern workplace cultures such a Westrum's "generative" culture and Dan Pink's *Drive*.

The two fundamental assumptions, Theory X and Theory Y, aren't arranged on a sliding scale. They are mutually exclusive. While organizations have become adept at the theater of modern workplace management, you'll spot a Theory X culture the second something goes wrong.

| Theory X | Theory Y|
|----|-------|
| Who's fault is this | Wha


McGregor considered Theory X and Theory Y to be two options that a manager would choose from after assessing the workplace. You would review the work and the people and decide whether you need an authoritarian style, or a more hands-off approach. What we have learned through the study of system failures is that generative cultures are safer than bureaucratic or pathological cultures.

## 

The military has traditionally been seen as a Theory X culture. Decisions are made by a small central group and there are tight constraints around interactions. However, the modern military uses a *mission command* pattern that decentralizes decision making by providing clear goals. The soldiers with boots on the ground are allowed to respond immediately as events unfold, rather than waiting for orders. This is the application of Theory Y culture.

In a study into coal mines, the high-performing mines were found to use a similar approach. The miners would self-organize and assign roles based on what work needed to be done. The miners were more engaged in the work, had less time off, and out-performed mines run in an authoritarian style.

When you feel safe to speak up and nobody will be blamed, near-misses and minor faults fuel learning. Each incident results in positive action to make the workplace safer, whether the industry is a factory, nuclear power plant, aviation, or software delivery.

If you don't feel safe to report close-calls, the unspoken risks accumulate until, very often, a disaster happens.

Outages and incidents fuel the increase in authoritarian and bureaucratic approaches. Policy constraints such as multiple sign-offs, or less frequent deployments, are the result of Theory X responses to past problems. There is no statistical basis for policy-based controls of software delivery risk.

Essentially, Theory X responds to problems with: "See, it went wrong. We knew they couldn't be trusted." Theory Y responds with curiosity, more concerned with changing the system to make problems less likely than in finding someone to blame.

> In 2022, we found that the biggest predictor of an organization's application-development security practices was cultural, not technical: high-trust, low-blame cultures focused on performance were significantly more likely to adopt emerging security practices. <cite>The Accelerate State of DevOps Report, 2022</cite>

One of the tragically amusing parts of what we call *modern workplace culture* is the ideas will soon be a hundred years old. Hardly modern! This shows how long it takes to change the prevailing thinking about management. Far more than one generation.

You'll find culture is the toughest nut to crack in DevOps. No matter how hard it is to automate your deployment pipeline, changing a collective management thought pipeline is far harder. You'll need to lean on studies that evidence the benefits of modern workplace culture, but you'll need more than hard numbers to convince most people.

Happy deployments!
