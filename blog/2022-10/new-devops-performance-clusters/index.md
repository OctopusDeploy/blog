- SDO performance metrics
  - The 4 DORA metrics became the 5 SDO performance metrics in 2018
  - Availability became reliability in 2021
  - "Teams who excel in all five measures exhibit exceptional organizational performance"

- The original performance clusters
  - Low, medium, high, and elite
  - In 2022, just low, medium, and high (elite and high rolled into one)
    - The high cluster (11%) performs between previous high and elite levels (as expected) but has got substantially smaller
    - The medium cluster is performing better than previously, and is the largest cluster (69%)
    - The low cluster is performing a little better than before, but has also grown (19%)
    - Yes, it adds up to 99% and also... it kinda depends on who writes back each year... so make sure you respond next year to give us all the most complete picture
    - Key fact... high performers deploy 417x more often than low performers!
  - Cluster table based on original 4 DORA metrics

- The new clusters are based on all 5 SDO metrics
  - Created because operations capability is critical for software delivery performance - organizations with great software delivery potential don't get results if the operations capability isn't there
  - Less judgmental, more descriptive
  - Starting, flowing (17%), slowing (>33%), retiring
  - You should take action if your plan doesn't align to the cluster description, if you find yourself in the Slowing or Retiring cluster for a core software product, you need to take action
  - If you are retiring software and find it ranks as retiring in the model, that's to be expected
  - Bear in mind how Google operates, they have lots of software products in various stages of their lifecycle, from established search and advertising products, to flagship cloud products, to long-tooth products that are destined to follow Google Reader and Google+. If you are working at a product company, you might have one really critical product and you really need to be in the flowing state. For line of business apps you might happy to cruise in slowing mode if the apps aren't creating a core differentiation from competitors, but otherwise you'll want to aim for flowing too.
  - *If your cluster doesn't match your product ambition, you need to pay attention to that and change*

- The flowing state
  - The following are more common in this cluster
    - Loosely coupled architectures
    - Flexible work arrangements
    - Version control and change management (code and configuration)
    - Continuous integration - more frequent integrations to the main branch
    - Continuous Delivery - they get changes into production safely, sustainably, and efficiently
    - Unlike other clusters, they manage high SDO performance without documentation, other clusters perform less well unless they have more documentation
    - The flowing cluster most needs generative culture and organizational performance suffers without it

    - Other clusters may achieve an adequate performance level, but at a far greater cost and with burnout, unplanned work, and low rates of software change... the retiring cluster is where large organizations with an ops team that reign supreme exist... no changes happen without their approval, so things are reliable, but slow and people will burn out (DENPLAN :)) A large organization is likely to be successful for reasons other than technology
    - It is likely more research is needed to further understand the clusters

- The real measures are organization wide, real-world performance against your commercial and non-commercial goals

Happy deployments!
