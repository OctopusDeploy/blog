DevOps has brought the topic of organization culture firmly to the table. While culture was always an element of Agile and Lean, the research into DevOps has shown that it is just as important as the more technical capabilities.

The DevOps structural equation model has 5 elements related to people and culture, so it's clear that human issues are crucial to high-performance. The 5 cultural capabilities in the model are:

- Climate for learning
- Westrum organizational culture
- Psychological safety
- Job satisfaction
- Identity

At the same time, there have been a number of HR topics across all industries that have trended over the past few years:

- Work to rule (quiet quitting)
- The Great Resignation / Reshuffle
- The four-day work week
- Hybrid working

As Emily Freeman (author of DevOps for Dummies) [said](https://emilyfreeman.io/#:~:text=I%20believe%20the%20biggest%20challenges%20facing%20tech%20aren%E2%80%99t%20technical%2C%20but%20human.):

> The biggest challenges facing tech aren't technical, but human.

So, where should you start when it comes to understanding culture in the context of DevOps?

## Fundamental assumption

In 1960, Douglas McGregor published a book called *The Human Side of Enterprise*. In the book, he described how a fundamental assumption about human behavior results in different management styles,

You either believe that:

- Theory X: People don't want to work and need to be motivated by rewards and punishments, or
- Theory Y: People are intrinsically motivated to do good work

Many decisions in the workplace involve a trade-off, but these fundamental assumptions are mutually exclusive. If you believe Theory X, you'll centralize decision making, track individual performance, and use rewards and punishments to motivate workers.

::hint
When you use external rewards, you'll often achieve short-term gains. This ultimately fails as a strategy as it reduces internal motivation. Alfie Kohn looked at hundreds of studies and concluded that incentives cause temporary obedience, but result in lasting harm to motivation.

Dan Pink expanded on Douglas McGregor's and Alfie Kohn's work in his popular book on motivation, *Drive*, which describes how people need context, autonomy, and purpose to reach high performance levels.
:::

With Theory Y, you focus on setting clear goals and let people direct their own efforts. When you do this, employees become the organization's most valuable asset.

McGregor considered Theory X and Theory Y to be two options that a manager would choose from after assessing a workplace. You would review the work and the people and decide whether you need an authoritarian style, or a more hands-off approach. What we have learned through the study of system failures cultures with high-trust and low-blame are safer than bureaucratic or pathological cultures.

Theory Y is foundational to Lean, Agile, and DevOps and is the underlying assumption of a generative culture.

## 

The military has traditionally been seen as a Theory X culture. Decisions are made by a small central group and there are tight constraints around interactions. However, the modern military uses a *mission command* pattern that decentralizes decision making by providing clear goals. The soldiers with boots on the ground are allowed to respond immediately as events unfold, rather than waiting for orders. This is the application of Theory Y culture.

Centralized intent + Decentralized execution, or shared vision implemented by cross-functional, self-organizing, autonomous teams.

The civilian version of this is called [workplace empowerment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment#In_workplace_management)

- Share information with everyone
- Create autonomy through boundaries
- Replace hierarchy with self-directed teams

In a study into coal mines, the high-performing mines were found to use a similar approach. The miners would self-organize and assign roles based on what work needed to be done. The miners were more engaged in the work, had less time off, and out-performed mines run in an authoritarian style.


## 

When you feel safe to speak up and nobody will be blamed, near-misses and minor faults fuel learning. Each incident results in positive action to make the workplace safer, whether the industry is a factory, nuclear power plant, aviation, or software delivery.

If you don't feel safe to report close-calls, the unspoken risks accumulate until, very often, a disaster happens.

:::

Outages and incidents fuel the increase in authoritarian and bureaucratic approaches. Policy constraints such as multiple sign-offs, or less frequent deployments, are the result of Theory X responses to past problems. There is no statistical basis for policy-based controls of software delivery risk.

Essentially, Theory X responds to problems with: "See, it went wrong. We knew they couldn't be trusted." Theory Y responds with curiosity, more concerned with changing the system to make problems less likely than in finding someone to blame.

> In 2022, we found that the biggest predictor of an organization's application-development security practices was cultural, not technical: high-trust, low-blame cultures focused on performance were significantly more likely to adopt emerging security practices. <cite>The Accelerate State of DevOps Report, 2022</cite>

If you are leading a team that has been subjected to years of unhealthy culture, you can't just snap your fingers and create a new world. Psychological safety requires long-term trust and empathy. You'll need to demonstrate how you respond to problems and gradually help the team lost the fear that was previously essential to their survival.

Even if you are a fully subscribed Theory Y, generative culture leader, your organization might be immune to your personal efforts. Just because a team won't be roasted by you doesn't mean there aren't managers in other departments waiting to pounce on them. If you find yourself a righteous middle, between a scared team and a pathological organization, you have to consider whether building a modern culture as a silo is healthy for the team or the organization in the long term. Teams build in this way rarely survive your departure.

If you can't make progress amongst your executive peers and the C-suite, it can be dangerous operating as a miniature sub-organization. It takes enormous energy to do this, but you might not be able to sustain it for months and years. If you eventually burn out, there is a danger you'll be assimilated into the pathological culture, or simply leave the organization, pulling the rug out from the team.

## Summary

Mission command dates back to the 1800s
Theory Y was in Douglas McGregor's 1960 book and dates back to the 1950s
Westrum's organizational cultures were defined in the 1980s

The key to this is that we aren't suddenly discovering new information, but gradually coming around to these ideas.


The root of modern culture is planted in Douglas McGregor's *Theory Y* assumption that people want to do good work. From this, we can see the benefits of a clear shared vision, with decentralized decision making.

Lean, Agile, and DevOps all advocate for this *empowered team* approach, using different terminology for local decision making.

One of the tragically amusing parts of what we call *modern workplace culture* is the ideas will soon be a hundred years old. Hardly modern! This shows how long it takes to change the prevailing thinking about management. Far more than one generation.

You'll find culture is the toughest nut to crack in DevOps. No matter how hard it is to automate your deployment pipeline, changing a collective management thought pipeline is far harder. You'll need to lean on studies that evidence the benefits of modern workplace culture, but you'll need more than hard numbers to convince most people.

While organizations have become adept at the theater of modern workplace management, you'll spot a Theory X culture the second something goes wrong.
