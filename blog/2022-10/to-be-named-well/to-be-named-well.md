DevOps has brought the topic of organization culture firmly to the table. While culture was always an element of Agile and Lean, the research into DevOps has shown that it is just as important as the more technical capabilities.

The DevOps structural equation model has 5 elements related to people and culture, so it's clear that human issues are crucial to high-performance. The 5 cultural capabilities in the model are:

- Climate for learning
- Westrum organizational culture
- Psychological safety
- Job satisfaction
- Identity

At the same time, there have been a number of HR topics across all industries that have trended over the past few years:

- Work to rule (quiet quitting)
- The Great Resignation / Reshuffle
- The four-day work week
- Hybrid working

As Emily Freeman (author of DevOps for Dummies) [said](https://emilyfreeman.io/#:~:text=I%20believe%20the%20biggest%20challenges%20facing%20tech%20aren%E2%80%99t%20technical%2C%20but%20human.):

> The biggest challenges facing tech aren't technical, but human.

So, where should you start when it comes to understanding culture in the context of DevOps?

## Fundamental assumption

In 1960, Douglas McGregor published a book called *The Human Side of Enterprise*. In the book, he described how a fundamental assumption about human behavior results in different management styles,

You either believe that:

- Theory X: People don't want to work and need to be motivated by rewards and punishments, or
- Theory Y: People are intrinsically motivated to do good work

Many decisions in the workplace involve a trade-off, but these fundamental assumptions are mutually exclusive. If you believe Theory X, you'll centralize decision making, track individual performance, and use rewards and punishments to motivate workers.

::hint
When you use external rewards, you'll often achieve short-term gains. This ultimately fails as a strategy as it reduces internal motivation. Alfie Kohn looked at hundreds of studies and concluded that incentives cause temporary obedience, but result in lasting harm to motivation.

Dan Pink expanded on Douglas McGregor's and Alfie Kohn's work in his popular book on motivation, *Drive*, which describes how people need context, autonomy, and purpose to reach high performance levels.
:::

With Theory Y, you focus on setting clear goals and let people direct their own efforts. When you do this, employees become the organization's most valuable asset.

McGregor considered Theory X and Theory Y to be two options that a manager would choose from after assessing a workplace. You would review the work and the people and decide whether you need an authoritarian style, or a more hands-off approach. What we have learned through the study of system failures cultures with high-trust and low-blame are safer than bureaucratic or pathological cultures.

Theory Y is foundational to Lean, Agile, and DevOps and is the underlying assumption of a generative culture.

## Mission command

Although military organizations are traditionally seen as Theory X cultures, modern military units operate using *mission command*. The mission command pattern decentralizes decision making by providing clear goals. The soldiers with boots on the ground are allowed to respond dynamically as events unfold, rather than waiting for orders. This is the application of Theory Y culture.

The civilian version of this is called [workplace empowerment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment#In_workplace_management), which requires that:

- You share information with everyone
- You create autonomy through boundaries
- You replace hierarchy with self-directed teams

Workplace empowerment combines centralized intent with decentralized execution. In software delivery, this typically involves a shared vision implemented by a cross-functional self-organizing team.

## Culture predicts safety

When you feel safe to speak up and nobody will be blamed, near-misses and minor faults fuel learning. Each incident results in positive action to make the workplace safer, whether the industry is manufacturing, nuclear power plant, aviation, or software delivery.

If you don't feel safe to report close-calls, the unspoken risks accumulate until, very often, a disaster happens.

You don't have to be in a safety-critical industry to benefit from this relationship. The same cultural traits that predict safety are also related to communication, collaboration, innovation, and problem solving. Culture affects the flow of information, which is critical to all these activities.

> In 2022, we found that the biggest predictor of an organization's application-development security practices was cultural, not technical: high-trust, low-blame cultures focused on performance were significantly more likely to adopt emerging security practices. <cite>The Accelerate State of DevOps Report, 2022</cite>

Theory X restricts the flow of information and limits who can take action. Information is drawn up, and decisions are passed back down.

Theory Y thinking leads to strong information flow and prompt action in response. Information flows freely and decisions are made close to the work.

## Changing culture

Changing team and organization culture is one of the toughest challenges you'll find in software delivery. Not even the most complex automation task in your deployment pipeline comes close. You'll need a clear vision of your intended future state, which needs to be pushed rapidly, firmly, and regularly to ensure the goal remains clear.

You'll need leaders and managers to understand their role is to enable self-organizing teams that make use of the talent of each team member. You will need to move away from systems that centralize information and decision making and transfer to systems aligned to distributed responsibility.

For example, if you are using centralized tools to organize tasks and assign them people, you'll need to move to a system that aligns with setting a clear mission without removing the ability of teams to self-organize and respond to dynamic situations. You may need to replace a tool entirely, or use the tool in a new way. Your Gantt charts might have to go, but your task tracking app can remain if the team can re-purpose it.

The leadership role in a culture change is to:

- Relentlessly push the desired end state
- Reinforce the role of leaders and managers as enablers
- Ensure teams become self-organized

A healthy culture should also be clear about the importance of the flow of information as well as setting a standard for communication style.

At Octopus we follow the Radical Candor approach. This allows us to be direct in our communications, but within a framework where we all care about each other. Radical Candor enables individuals to show courage and challenge others when they might otherwise remain silent. This ultimately means we can all do better work, without harmful or toxic behavior.

Without a clear, robust, and sustained push, you won't make a dent on culture. You'll have to overcome inertia and battle organizational immune responses. Despite the difficulty, the research is conclusive that culture is crucial to high-performance.

## Summary

Mission command dates back to the 1800s
Theory Y was in Douglas McGregor's 1960 book and dates back to the 1950s
Westrum's organizational cultures were defined in the 1980s

The key to this is that we aren't suddenly discovering new information, but gradually coming around to these ideas.


The root of modern culture is planted in Douglas McGregor's *Theory Y* assumption that people want to do good work. From this, we can see the benefits of a clear shared vision, with decentralized decision making.

Lean, Agile, and DevOps all advocate for this *empowered team* approach, using different terminology for local decision making.

One of the tragically amusing parts of what we call *modern workplace culture* is the ideas will soon be a hundred years old. Hardly modern! This shows how long it takes to change the prevailing thinking about management. Far more than one generation.

You'll find culture is the toughest nut to crack in DevOps. No matter how hard it is to automate your deployment pipeline, changing a collective management thought pipeline is far harder. You'll need to lean on studies that evidence the benefits of modern workplace culture, but you'll need more than hard numbers to convince most people.

While organizations have become adept at the theater of modern workplace management, you'll spot a Theory X culture the second something goes wrong.
