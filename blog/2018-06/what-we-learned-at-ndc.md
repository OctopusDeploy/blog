![What We Learned Banner](todo.png)

Alex, Andrew, Paul, and Ryan attended NDC Oslo last week. When we weren't chatting with attendees at our booth (or sampling one of the many delicious food options available), we were able to enjoy some of the sessions offered this year.

## Tabs, spaces and salaries: a data science detective story

In this talk, [Evelina Gabasova](https://twitter.com/evelgab) used statistical analysis and F# to investigate why the StackOverflow Developer Survey results seemed to suggest that [developers that use spaces make more than developers that use tabs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/).

Evelina taught us to go beyond "correlation is not equal to causation" and some tools to find out whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. Did you know that countries with higher birth rates also have larger stork populations?

We looked at other survey answers that might have explained the link between spaces and salary. She also talked whether the data could be trusted. And with anonymous surveys, the answer is no.

## The F# Path To Relaxation

[Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsyme) talked about F# from a language designer's point of view and how F# manages to reconcile what appear to be contradictory ideas.

We got at look at how the language has grown to support functional principles and support interoperability, object programming, and practicality. There is also the interesting story of F# balances being an enterprise supported language and having a great amount of openness and a strong open source community.

[Much like life, F# finds a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjQ3hA9mEA).

## How to network if youâ€™re scared of people

[Kasia Rachuta](https://twitter.com/korachuta) shared her experience of moving countries and building a network from scratch.

This talk had a lot of good information on why you would want to build a professional network and what benefits you might get from one - and it's not all just about job hunting. Networks help you make new friends, find a mentor (or a mentee), and increase your knowledge.

After the benefits, Kasia shared some ways to network like meetups, social media groups, and volunteering. She also shared some tips on how to get the most out of those opportunities.

And finally, we learned about maintaining a network with suggestions and tips on how to best follow up with people and valuing their time. If you're looking to expand your professional network, you'll want to watch this video when it's released.
