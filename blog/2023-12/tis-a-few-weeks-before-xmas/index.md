Tis a few weeks before Christmas, for many in DevOps,
Soon not a sprint will start, not even at Microsoft.
Late updates will commit, last-minute deployments will get done,
And those who celebrate the holidays will gear up for some fun.

So what better time to reflect and celebrate,
To think of the year behind, and how we improved deployment rates.
2023 has been a raging success,
So let's look all the things Octopus did that only it does best.

## How we improved Octopus

*"We like solving problems for software teams,
And we work hard on new features so you can deploy at great speed.
If multi-tenancy, Kubernetes, or operations get you blue,
In 2023, Octopus might have released the right features for you."*

This year, we invested our time heavily in 3 core areas: Kubernetes, tenanted deployments, and improvements that help you manage and understand scale.

Here are some of the standout features and changes we made to Octopus in 2023:

### Better Kubernetes deployments

- [Live Kubernetes object status check](https://octopus.com/blog/live-updates-kubernetes-objects-deployments) - See how objects in your Kubernetes clusters are performing to help with maintenance and troubleshooting
- [Kustomize support added](https://octopus.com/docs/deployments/kubernetes/kustomize) - Our new Kustomize step allows you to use one YAML template and easily adjust it for your apps, environments, or tenants
- [Get Kubernetes configuration straight from Git](https://octopus.com/blog/manifests-from-git) - Save time spent on packaging and use one repository for many projects

### Better multi-tenancy deployments

- [Tenants dashboard makeover](https://octopus.com/blog/redesigned-tenant-overview-dashboard) - It's now easier to track projects, environments, and tenant tags for all your tenants
- [Tenant bulk actions](https://octopus.com/blog/connect-project-multiple-tenants-bulk-action) - Easier tenant management at scale

### Reduced manual intervention

- [Step retries](https://octopus.com/blog/step-retries) - Automatically retry deployment steps to reduce manual intervention when connectivity problems strike
- [Step timeouts](https://octopus.com/blog/execution-timeouts) - Set steps to timeout to help catch the times when processes hang
- [Resilient Tentacles](https://octopus.com/blog/tentacle-communication-resiliency) - Tentacles now automatically retry after communications failures

### More integration

- [New and improved GitHub Actions](https://octopus.com/github) - Enjoy seamless GitHub integration and kick your deployment tasks with our new Actions
- [OpenID Connect for both GitHub and Microsoft Azure](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/openid-connect/github-actions) - Add either tool to your deployment pipeline with ease

### Great UI changes:

- Version-controlled variables - Manage variables alongside your deployment process code and scope them to environments, roles, targets, and more
- [Reprioritize tasks](https://octopus.com/blog/reprioritize-task-queue) - Easily shuffle tasks around in runbooks and deployments as priorities changes
- New onboarding process - Our improved onboarding helps you get to grips with Octopus faster

### But wait, there's more!

These are just our standout updates. Check out our [What's new?](https://octopus.com/whatsnew) page to see *all* our changes and improvements to Octopus this year.

We're always working on improving Octopus, however, and next year's planned improvements include:

- A new, dedicated Kubernetes Tentacle Tentacle to deploy to many clusters without compromising on enterprise-grade security
- GitHub App to connect Octopus and GitHub without managing credentials
- Resilient Deployment Pipeline to scale to 1000 concurrent deployments and more
- Config-as-Code for Octopus Runbooks
- Terraform Provider enhancements
- Streamlined project setup
- More usability, performance, and small improvements that make for happy deployments

[See our roadmap](https://roadmap.octopus.com/tabs/2-planned) to stay in the loop about what's coming next.

## We travelled the world to meet you

*"We travelled the world, though slower than Saint Nick,
To meet you in person at industry gigs.
We showed off Octopus, talked shop, and heard of your pains,
We learned lots, made friends, and can't wait to do it again."*

We at Octopus found so much value in meeting everyone at many of this year's industry events, including:

- NDC London and Oslo
- KubeCon Europe and North America in both Amsterdam and Chicago
- GitHub Universe in San Francisco
- DevOps Enterprise Summit in Las Vegas
- Gartner Sydney

We also *loved* talking about Octopus and sharing our experiences at events like: 

- Web Directions
- ProductTank
- Women in Tech
- Google Developer Group
- SSW .NET Group
- Cloud Native Summit

A heartfelt thanks to anyone who stopped to talk to us or heard what we had to say. If you're a regular attendee of these events, we look forward to seeing you in person again next year!

## We launched our own event with SHIPPED23

*"Not just content with our travels, we held an event of our own,
With SHIPPED23, where we shared what we know.
We talked software delivery in all the ways we could glean,
Bringing the smartest of Octopus right to your screen."*

On November 15, we held our own virtual conference in the form of SHIPPED23.

SHIPPED23 featured talks covering many aspects of software delivery, from concepts, best practices, and Octopus itself. Our talks included:

- Accelerating software delivery at scale
- What's new for Octopus and what's on the roadmap (some of which we've covered here)
- How we're scaling Octopus Cloud
- Real-world release pipelines with GitHub Actions and Octopus Deploy
- Beyond GitOps: How to apply Kubernetes best practices to enterprises' reality
- Tracking, predicting, and preventing performance regressions in Octopus
- New features for tenanted deployments
- DORA, DevOps, and deployments
- Multi-tenancy architecture lessons learned

Watch the event via our YouTube playlist:

## Our website continues to improve

*"Octopus's website is a wonderful tool,
It's where we give updates and explain our value to you.
Its development is an ongoing task,
But we made massive steps in the year that's just passed."*

In late 2022, we gave our homepage a new look, but our work didn't stop there.

We've been redeveloping our website over the entire year, so it better explains how Octopus simplifies enterprise, tenanted, and Kubernetes deployments.

We have new pages that explain how Octopus helps with specific deployment strategies:

- [Tenanted deployments](https://octopus.com/use-case/tenanted-deployments)
- [Kubernetes deployments](https://octopus.com/use-case/kubernetes)
- [Container deployments](https://octopus.com/use-case/container-deployments)

We have new feature pages:

- [Octopus Tenants](https://octopus.com/features/tenants)
- [GitHub Actions](https://octopus.com/github)

We also told the Octopus story in brand new ways:

- [We are Octopus](https://octopus.com/company) - about us and the timeline of the company's timeline
- [Octopus customer stories](https://octopus.com/company/customers) - read about how we made the lives of software teams much easier

## 2023 in stats

*"Like many in tech, we love some good stats,
So we hit up our experts whose data we track.
From all of the areas from which we hold dear,
Here are some factoids from another great year."*

To finish, here are some fun stats about Octopus's year (at the time of writing):

- Our customers completed over **44,626,113** deployments
- We had over **7,914** new trials
- Our customers ran over **600,000** Kubernetes steps each month
- We archived over **234,621,521** audit events in Octopus Cloud with our new audit log archiving feature
- We had **749,452** pageviews on our blog. [Checking Kubernetes pod CPU and memory](https://octopus.com/blog/kubernetes-pod-cpu-memory) was our most popular post, with **34,405** views.

<!-- WAITING ON UPDATED STATS

## Happy deployments to all, and to all a good night!

As you can see, Octopus had a terrific year, and we can't wait to keep helping software teams with complex deployments in 2024.

Just a reminder that staff at Octopus take a well-earned rest over the holidays. Fret not, [we'll still be available to support you](https://octopus.com/support) if needed.
