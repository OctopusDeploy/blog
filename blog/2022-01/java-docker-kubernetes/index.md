In this blog post, I built a Maven Java project and hosted the image on the Google Container Registry (GCR). I access the GCR through Octopus Deploy and deploy the Java application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). To follow along, you will need:

- A Google Cloud Platform Account
- A Microsoft Azure Account
- An Octopus Deploy instance - to link the [Azure Account to the Octopus Deploy instance](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/accounts/azure#azure-service-principal).
- Access to a terminal, either locally or in the cloud, with gcloud and the azure command line interface installed

## The Octopus Deploy Underwater App

The Octopus Deploy Underwater App is a landing page for users creating their first deployment. It showcases relevant articles for users as well as links to other resources.

You can find the web application repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/octopus-underwater-app). The repository is split into separate branches for different use cases. We will be using the underwater-app-java branch.

## Building and pushing to a registry

We will use the command line to build the Java project and use gcloud to push the image to GCR.

Configure the gcloud tool to point to your PROJECT_ID.

    gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>

Clone the java project repository that we will use to build and deploy to Azure.

    git clone https://github.com/terence-octo/octopus-underwater-app
    cd octopus-underwater-app
    git checkout underwater-app-java

Test the application locally by using the run command and visiting http://localhost:8080/ 

    chmod +x mvnw
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    
Running the package step builds the target JAR deployable for the app.

    ./mvnw package
    
Enable the container registry to store the container image.

    gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=`gcloud config list --format="value(core.project)"`
    
Run this command to create the config.json with the correct settings

    gcloud auth configure-docker
    
The jib tool creates and pushes the image to the container registry.

    ./mvnw com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:build -Dimage=gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/octopus-underwater-app:latest
    
Confirm that the image is present on the GCR by going to the [registry home page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry).

## Retrieve Credentials from Azure for Octopus Deploy

We need to retrieve some credentials to pass to Octopus Deploy. Follow these steps to [add an Azure Service Principle to Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/accounts/azure).

## Create Azure Kubernetes Cluster

Now we switch to Microsoft Azure to host our Kubernetes cluster. Octopus Deploy is cloud-agnostic. It can work with deployments that span multiple cloud providers. 

Create a new Kubernetes cluster by going to your resource group and creating a Kubernetes service. Give the cluster a name and accept all default options.

## Octopus Steps

### Add Deployment Target

Go to **Infrastructure &rarr; Deployment Targets &rarr; Add Deployment Target &rarr; Kubernetes Cluster** and fill out the fields using the Azure Service Principle set up earlier. Assign a unique role for the deployment. 

### Add External Feeds

For Octopus to access the image stored in the GCR, enable the [google feed](https://octopus.com/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/guides/google-container-registry).

### Set up deployment steps

In a project, add the deploy Kubernetes containers step.

![Deploy Kubernetes Containers Step](deploy-kubernetes-containers-step.png "Deploy Success")

### YAML file

Click the Edit YAML box and paste the following YAML file in the box. The YAML file will populate the various settings in the Octopus UI. You will have to replace the PROJECT_ID with your google PROJECT_ID. Using the google external feed credentials set up earlier, you can also use the UI to select the container image manually.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: java-web-underwater
  labels:
    app: java-web-app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: java-web-app
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: java-web-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: java-web-app
          image: gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/octopus-underwater-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### Service

Paste the following YAML into the Service section of the step. This will create an Azure Service through the Octopus client.

```

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: underwater-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: web
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: java-web-app

```

### Deploy to Azure

Click SAVE.

Click Create Release and click through the steps to deploy the application to Azure.

### Runbooks as a Kubernetes monitoring tool 

You can  set up monitoring of your kubernetes resources through runbooks. Go to your project dashboard then **Runbooks &rarr; Add Runbook &rarr; Define your Runbook Process &rarr; Add Step &rarr; Kubernetes - Inspect Resource**

![Inspect Kubernetes Octopus](inspect-kubernetes-octopus.png)

Assign the role you set for your deployment target and you can replicate the `kubectl get service` command by setting the **Resource** and **Kubectl Verb**. 

![Get Service](get-service.png)

Click **Save** then **Run**

This is useful as the runbooks can be shared across teams. Monitoring can then be done at an organization level rather than individually on local machines. Go to the task log to see the `underwwater-service` you just created. You will see an IP address under `External IP`. Go to this address and you will see the Octopus Underwater app.

In this blog post, you have built the  Octopus Deploy Underwater App and pushed the image to GCR. You used Octopus Deploy to reference this image and deploy the image to AKS.

Happy Deployments!
