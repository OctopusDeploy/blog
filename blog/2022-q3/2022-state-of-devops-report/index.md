Each year, we look forward to the release of the Accelerate State of DevOps Report. The report, from Google Cloud and DORA, is academically rigorous and is the longest running research effort of its kind, providing key insights into the practices and capabilities needed to achieve high performance in software delivery.

From the report, we have learned what combination of technical and cultural techniques are needed to drive strong performance at the organization level.

We are even more excited than ever this year, as Octopus has sponsored the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report.

## New discoveries

One of the big headlines from this year's report concerns security. It was found that the biggest predictor for security practices was cultural, not technical. A generative culture results in high levels of security practices, which benefit teams by reducing burnout and helps the organization to achieve high performance against the commercial and non-commercial goals.

> With security top of mind for every organization, we found that teams 
> with high trust and low-blame cultures focused on performance were 
> significantly more likely to successfully adopt effective security 
> practices.
> 
> Itâ€™s more obvious than ever that organizational culture 
> and modern development processes are the best place to start for 
> organizations looking to improve their security posture.

In the 2022 report, you'll also find changes in the following areas:

- Further insights on the role of _reliability_ in performance
- Rates of adoption of cloud technologies
- A change to the performance categories
- A new categorization of respondents into clusters
- The relationship between inner loop and outer loop practices
- How security frameworks improve performance

Happy deployments!
