Each year, we look forward to the release of the Accelerate State of DevOps Report. The report, from Google Cloud and DORA, is academically rigorous and is the [longest running research effort of its kind](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html), providing key insights into the practices and capabilities needed to achieve high performance in software delivery.

From the report, we have learned what combination of technical and cultural techniques are needed to drive strong performance at the organization level. The list of capabilities and their relationships is based on more than 33,000 survey responses.

We are even more excited than ever this year, as Octopus has sponsored the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report, published on September 28th.

## Background

The Accelerate State of DevOps Report has been running for 8 years, tracking the practices and capabilities that predict high performance in software delivery. The DORA metrics are one of the practical tools to emerge from the report.

In 2021, the key insights included:

- How culture mitigated burnout
- Where cloud adoption was a driver for performance
- How performance is impacted by software supply chain security
- How documentation improved security, reliability, and cloud usage

The [4 DORA metrics](https://octopus.com/blog/dora-metrics-devops-business-outcomes) were also updated to add a 5th for _reliability_.

## New insights in 2022

As always, the new report contains new insights and you'll find several changes in [this year's report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/).

One of the headlines is that the biggest predictor for security practices is cultural, not technical. If your team has a high-trust/low blame culture, you're more likely to adopt appropriate security practices. These practices increase software delivery and operational performance and reduce burnout.

When you have good practices for security, you're performance increases while the likelihood of burnout reduces. For you organization, this means stronger commercial and non-commercial performance.

> Itâ€™s more obvious than ever that organizational culture 
> and modern development processes are the best place to start for 
> organizations looking to improve their security posture.

There are also insights for:

- The role of _reliability_ in performance
- Rates of adoption of cloud technologies
- A new categorization of respondents into clusters
