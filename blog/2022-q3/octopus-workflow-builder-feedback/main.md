What are modern DevOps teams looking for in their continuous delivery workflows? Continuous integration, cloud deployments, feature branching, testing, Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), and dependency vulnerability scanning are just a few of the features that high performing teams need to quickly deliver and maintain high quality software.

But how do you *actually* implement these processes? We've shared a lot of opinions in this blog over the years to help teams get the most out of Octopus, but it sometimes felt like we were jumping to the end of the story. This left you, the reader, to build your own sample applications, cloud infrastructure, and Octopus configuration before following along with our latest how-to guide.

We want you to experience the power and joy of a modern continuous delivery workflow, but without spending days setting up your tools. This is why we built the Octopus Workflow Builder, and we'd love your feedback on this early release.

## What is the Octopus Workflow Builder



### Sub headings

Use three ### to include H3 headings.

Use **Bold** text for UI labels, use single back-ticks for `parameters` and `filepaths`, and three back-ticks for code blocks:

```
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```

Use the following (minus the back-ticks) to include images:

```
![Alt text, a description of the image](placeholderimg.png "width=500")*Optional caption text*
```
If including images, please include alt text. Alt text is primarily used to describe images to people unable to see them, and can be 125 characters max including spaces. You can also include an image caption if the reader would benefit from additional information or context.
