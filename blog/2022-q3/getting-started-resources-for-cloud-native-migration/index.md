Cloud-native technologies have emerged as a way to gain a competitive advantage through benefits like scalability, economies of scale, and global reach. Migrating to the cloud and modernizing systems is an important issue for most IT professionals. Despite the clear need, there can be some challenges to knowing where to start.

At Octopus, we meet this challenge by providing some resources for getting started with cloud migration. These resources are a mix of internally developed tools, whitepapers and guides as well as external reports 

## Whitepapers

At Octopus, we want to provide you with in-depth research about issues that are important to us and our customers. As a cloud-native dedicated continuous delievery tool, we are invested in continuous delivery and cloud-native technologies.

### Migrating to the cloud whitepaper

The migrating to the cloud whitepaper provides an argument for migrating to the cloud as well as first steps to take when migrating.

### Importance of continuous delivery whitepaper

The importance of continuous delivery whitepaper makes the case for using continuous delivery in your deployment practices.

## Octopus free tools

We have developed some free tools to address common customer problems. These tools help remove some of the barriers to getting started with modern CI/CD pipelines.

### Workflow Builder

The Octopus workflow builder was born out of a need to get users started quickly in a cloud CI/CD workflow. Users provide a GitHub repository and credentials and the workflow builder will automatically set up a deployment pipeline, managed by Octopus and deployed to a cloud platform.

### Kubernetes YAML generator

When you are working with Kubernetes, you will need to supply a YAML configuration file for your deployments. The Kubernetes YAML generator is a UI-based tool that lets you easily generate Kubernetes compliant YAML code. This code can be pasted directly into the Octopus UI to help you get started quickly with Kubernetes deployments.

## External reports

When you are validating your cloud-native approach, it is useful to be aligned with the broader cloud community. External reports provide surveys of cloud usage, best practices and use cases that you can use to back up your strategies.

## State of the cloud reports

State of the cloud reports give a snapshot in time of the major trends towards cloud-native.

## Best-practice reports

If you want to migrate to the cloud, you need to understand the best practices that major cloud providers have used to become cloud native.

## Octopus supporting resources

At Octopus, we have authored several blogs and guides that can help you with cloud-migration. 

### The ten pillars of pragmatic kubernetes deployments

We wrote an [eBook on getting started with Kubernetes](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/TenPillarsK8s/releases/tag/0.1.269-main)
