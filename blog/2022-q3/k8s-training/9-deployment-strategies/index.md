This post is the 9th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an automated, multi-environment deployment process so you can deploy containerized applications with speed and reliability. 

Watch in realtime as pods are redeployed with different deployment strategies.

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
