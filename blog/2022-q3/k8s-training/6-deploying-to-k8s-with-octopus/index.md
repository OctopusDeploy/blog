This post is the 6th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus.

This video introduces many Octopus concepts such as:

- Environments
- Certificates
- Targets
- Workers

It then demonstrates how to integrate Octopus with a Kubernetes cluster and perform a deployment.

[If you don't already have Octopus account, you can start a free trial.](https://oc.to/octopus-k8s-training-trial)

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
