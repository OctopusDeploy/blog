This post is the 7th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus.

This video builds a second Kubernetes cluster for the production environment, adds it to Octopus, and demonstrates how deployments are progressed through multiple environments.

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
