This post opens our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an automated, multi-environment deployment process so you can deploy containerized applications with speed and reliability. 

First is getting started with Docker. The video below demonstrates how to install Docker on Linux and discusses how to install Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS.

If you don't already have Octopus account, you can [start a free trial](https://octopus.com/start).

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
