This post is the 15th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. 

This video introduces the Ingress resource and Ingress Controllers, which are used to implement advanced networking in a Kubernetes cluster.

If you want to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, try the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/). The Builder populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
