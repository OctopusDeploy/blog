This post is the fourth in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an automated, multi-environment deployment process so you can deploy containerized applications with speed and reliability. 

This video demonstrates Kubernetes pods, ReplicaSets, and deployments, deploying examples of each.

## Sample Pod YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: underwater
spec:
  containers:
  - name: webapp
    image: octopussamples/underwater-app
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

## Sample ReplicaSet YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: octopussamples/underwater-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Sample Deployment YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: octopussamples/underwater-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
