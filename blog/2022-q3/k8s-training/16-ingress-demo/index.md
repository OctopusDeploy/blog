If youu want to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, try the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/). The Builder populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
