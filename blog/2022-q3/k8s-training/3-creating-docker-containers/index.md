This post is the third in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an automated, multi-environment deployment process so you can deploy containerized applications with speed and reliability. 

This video demonstrates how Docker images are built and run in containers and covers concepts such as Docker registries and repositories.

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
