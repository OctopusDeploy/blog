This post is the tenth in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an automated, multi-environment deployment process so you can deploy containerized applications with speed and reliability.

Watch the blue/green deployment strategy, which is a custom strategy orchestrated by Octopus.

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
