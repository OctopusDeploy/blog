This post is the 17th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. 

This video demonstrates how to import an existing complex microservice application provided by Google called [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/) into Octopus to provide independently deployable applications.

[If you don't already have Octopus account, you can start a free trial.](https://oc.to/octopus-k8s-training-trial)

If you want to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, try the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/). The Builder populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
