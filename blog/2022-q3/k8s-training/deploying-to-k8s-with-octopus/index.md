This video introduces many Octopus concepts such as:

* Environments
* Targets
* Workers

It then demonstrates how to integrate Octopus with a Kubernetes cluster and perform a deployment.

## Learn more

If you are looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures an Hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
