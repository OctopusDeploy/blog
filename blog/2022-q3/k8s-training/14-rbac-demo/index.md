This post is the 14th in our Kubernetes training series, providing DevOps engineers with an introduction to Docker, Kubernetes, and Octopus. 

This video demonstrates how to create an Octopus target that authenticates to the cluster with a service account token.

If you're looking to build and deploy containerized applications to AWS platforms such as EKS and ECS, the [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/#/) populates a GitHub repository with a sample application built with GitHub Actions workflows and configures a hosted Octopus instance with sample deployment projects demonstrating best practices such as vulnerability scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Happy deployments!
