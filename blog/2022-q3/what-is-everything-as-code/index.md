Everything as Code (EaC) is an approach to software development and DevOps that uses code to define and manage IT resources. The code representation of resources makes it easier for developers to audit changes, roll back to previous versions, and transfer settings from one environment to another. EaC is an ideal state where every part of the software lifecycle can be represented as code. Applications today are far from that ideal, with EaC being used as an umbrella term used to cover specific applications of the as-code framework. Infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration as code (CaC) are the most popular EaC applications, with several offshoot applications such as environments as code, data pipelines as code or encryption management as code gaining popularity. This blog will discuss IaC, EaC, some upcoming as code applications, benefits to EaC and the future of EaC.


## Infrastructure as Code

IaC is the process of provisioning IT infrastructure through code. Traditionally, IT infrastructure was provisioned manually. Manual management of IT resources increases the shadow IT footprint of an organization because IT infrastructure is not provisioned in a standard way.

## Configuration as Code

CaC is the process of capturing all configuration settings of a system in code.

## Other Examples

- Environments as Code
- Data Pipelines as Code
- Encryption Management as Code

## Benefits

- Consistency
- Scalability
- Version Control
- Auditability
- Portability

## Future predictions/implications

## Conclusion

Happy deployments!
