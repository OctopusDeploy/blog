## Introduction

Cloud solutions have gained popularity over traditional IT systems. A [study by Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-09-gartner-says-more-than-half-of-enterprise-it-spending) indicates that revenue for cloud products are set to overtake traditional IT solutions in 2025.

To achieve the revenue gains, there is a need to optimize cloud solutions to make them more efficient and cost effective. Cloud orchestration is the co-ordination and automation of workloads, resources and infrastructure on public and private cloud environments. Cloud orchestration has to do with automating the whole cloud system. Each part in the system should work together to produce an efficient, well-oiled machine. Often used interchangeably, cloud automation is a subset of cloud orchestration that is focused on automating the individual parts of a cloud system. Both cloud orchestration and automation complement each other to produce an automated cloud system.

Cloud services are delivered in three main models:

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
