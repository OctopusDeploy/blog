## Introduction

Cloud solutions have gained popularity over traditional IT systems. A [study by Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-09-gartner-says-more-than-half-of-enterprise-it-spending) indicates that revenue for cloud products are set to overtake traditional IT solutions in 2025.

To achieve the revenue gains, there is a need to optimize cloud solutions to make them more efficient and cost effective. Cloud orchestration is the co-ordination and automation of workloads, resources and infrastructure on public and private cloud environments. Cloud orchestration is the automation of the whole cloud system. Each part in the system should work together to produce an efficient, well-oiled machine. Cloud automation is a subset of cloud orchestration that is focused on automating the individual parts of a cloud system. Both cloud orchestration and automation complement each other to produce an automated cloud system.

Cloud services are delivered in three main models:

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model where a software solution is provided on-demand and hosted by the provider. SaaS solutions often have a subscription fee or freemium pricing model to access the service. The benefits of this approach is that users do not have to install and host the application and can access only what they need. Some examples of SaaS solutions are Dropbox, Google Apps like Gmail or Netflix.


### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS platforms give developers complete cloud development and deployment environment. Developers can load operating systems and development tools on VMs. PaaS provides a contained environment to build cloud applications without needing to manage licensing or underlying application infrastructure. Platforms like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services are examples of PaaS.


### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides an on-demand service to deploy IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, servers, networks, and storage. IaaS is structured as pay-as-you-go where users pay for the infrastructure they need, when they need it. Examples of IaaS platforms include Digital Ocean, or AWS EC2. 

SaaS systems are often build on IaaS or PaaS platforms and PaaS platforms are often built on IaaS platforms.
