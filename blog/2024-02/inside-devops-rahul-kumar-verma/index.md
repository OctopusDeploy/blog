This post is the next in our [Inside DevOps series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/Inside%20DevOps), where we share lessons learned from those on the frontlines of DevOps.  

Hear from [Rahul Kumar Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-kumar-verma-558812161/), DevOps Engineer at Infosys, a  global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting.

**What is DevOps to you? How do you define it?**

*Rahul:* DevOps to me is like a well-choreographed dance between developers and operations teams, where they seamlessly collaborate to deliver and maintain software. For example, let's imagine developers writing code for a new feature. Simultaneously, automated tools ensure Continuous Integration, testing, and deployment. This harmonious interaction helps achieve faster, more reliable software releases.

**How did your DevOps journey start?**

*Rahul:* My journey in DevOps started in 2021. I became interested in streamlining the software development lifecycle and improving collaboration between development and operations teams. 

In my early experiences, I focused on implementing Continuous Integration and deployment pipelines to automate build and release processes. Over time, I’ve gained hands-on experience with various DevOps tools and methodologies. I've been involved in application development and maintenance projects where I applied DevOps principles to enhance efficiency and reliability in software delivery. I'm continually learning and adapting to new technologies and practices in the ever-evolving field of DevOps.

**What's the most challenging part of DevOps?**

*Rahul:* I think it depends on the organization and its circumstances. The most common challenges I’ve seen are implementing a cultural shift and fostering collaboration between siloed development and operations teams. Overcoming resistance to change and promoting a shared responsibility for the entire software delivery process is a significant part of DevOps adoption. You also need to choose the right tools and ensure they work seamlessly together. Automating and integrating security on each environment’s levels are constant challenges too.

**What's the most rewarding part of DevOps?**

*Rahul:* The most rewarding aspect of DevOps is its transformative power to create a synergy between development and operations. It fosters a culture of collaboration, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement. Witnessing the break down of traditional silos, DevOps empowers teams to work towards common goals, leading to faster time-to-market, enhanced software quality, and increased business agility. 

**What DevOps trend have you been following lately?**

*Rahul:* The adoption of cloud-native technologies, like Kubernetes and Docker. I follow it closely and I use these technologies in my current projects.

**What are some DevOps best practices your organization has implemented?**

*Rahul:* We keep the focus on automating the manual tasks, especially the build and release processes. Other DevOps best practices include integration of security tools into CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure set-up, deletion of un-used cloud resources, preparing the project documents, and daily scrum calls. These activities give me a clear picture of things happening in the project.

**What's the biggest challenge Octopus has helped you with?**

*Rahul:* Octopus Deploy facilitates reliable rollback and roll-forward mechanisms. If an issue arises during deployment, we can easily revert to a previous version or proceed with a newer version. This minimizes downtime and impact on users.

Also, Octopus supports deployment to a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and cloud environments. This flexibility is beneficial when working with diverse technology stacks and hybrid infrastructure.

**What advice would you give someone just starting their DevOps journey?**

*Rahul:*  Focus on understanding the collaborative essence of DevOps. Cultivate a mindset of continuous learning and diving into hands-on experiences with key tools. Begin small, automate relentlessly, and prioritize effective communication and teamwork. 

Embrace failure as a learning opportunity, stay curious about emerging technologies, and remember that DevOps is as much about people and culture as it is about automation. 

Commit to the journey, be patient with the process, and relish the satisfaction of witnessing improved collaboration, faster delivery, and increased efficiency in your software development practices.

**What DevOps book would you recommend reading?**

*Rahul:*  My must-read is the *[DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations](https://octopus.com/devops/reading-list/#the-devops-handbook)* by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis.

**What's one thing about you that might surprise us?**

*Rahul:* One thing that might surprise you is my deep connection to agriculture and farming. Growing up in a farmer family, I developed a profound appreciation for the land and the hard work that goes into cultivating crops. This background has instilled in me a strong work ethic and resilience. It shaped my perspective on sustainability and the importance of responsible resource management. 

While my professional journey may seem unrelated, the values instilled in me through farming continue to influence my approach to problem-solving, emphasizing long-term thinking and a commitment to positively impacting the environment whenever possible.
