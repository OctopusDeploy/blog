You can now assign a **static IP address** to your Octopus Cloud instance! This opens up new possibilities for simplifying and securing your configuration, for example:

- Connect to Listening Tentacles within your infrastructure from the Cloud
- Whitelist the static IP address of the Octopus server in your network configuration
- Allow connections to Linux or Unix SSH targets from the static IP address only

To activate your Static IP address today, [log in to your Octopus Account](https://account.octopus.com/instances), select 'Change Billing' and pick a plan with the new option to **purchase a static IP address for $10 per month**, as shown below:

With this new feature, we're happy to improve the convenience of Octopus Cloud and reduce your networking and infrastructure hassles.

Happy Cloud Deployments!
