We have been working towards improving our user experience at Octopus Deploy. Specifically addressing feedback about our interface looking “messy” and “hard to navigate”.  Addressing these concerns requires a layout that presents information in an easy-to-read structure.

## Page Layouts
We began by looking at our project page layouts. Here we identified a couple of key elements that needed improving. In the image below the highlighted areas is where we placed our focus. These areas contained our page headings and breadcrumbs. Page headings and breadcrumbs are important for understanding your location in the app.

Once we arrived at a design that worked well for projects, we then took this layout across the entire app. See new layout below.

### Benefits of this change
The benefits of this change provides an easier-to-understand Octopus Deploy interface. The headings now have an appropriate size and placement relative to the page content. The breadcrumbs now have appropriate visual treatment and their behaviour is applied consistently. By placing the create release button in the top right corner near other page actions is a more intuitive location. Customers were having trouble remembering where the create release button was located. 


### A few other notable improvements
*Improved experience for first time users through consistant layouts & illustrations.
*Loading state animations are now 
*Menu interaction states are clearer
*Simplified project navigation by removing headings and updating labels
