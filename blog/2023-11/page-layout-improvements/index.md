We have been working towards improving our user experience at Octopus Deploy, specifically addressing feedback around our interface looking “messy” and “hard to navigate”. To help address these concerns we needed to provide a layout that better articulated the information on the page. 

## Page Layouts
Looking at our project page layout we identified a couple key elements that needed improving. In the image below the highlighted areas is where we placed our focus. These areas contained our page headings and breadcrumbs which help users understand where they are located within the application and how to get back.

Once we arrived at a design that worked well for projects, we then took this design across the entire app.

### Benefits of this change
The benefits of this change provides an easier to understand Octopus Deploy UI. By implementing page headings that are the appropriate size and placement in relation to the rest of the page content. Best practise application of breadcrumbs enabling customers to understand their location and navigate within the same context. In addition, reducing cognitive load of customers trying to remember where the create release button is located by placing it in a more intuitive location near other page actions. 


### A few other notable improvements
*Improved experience for first time users through consistant layouts & illustrations.
*Loading state animations are now 
*Menu interaction states are clearer
*Simplified project navigation by removing headings and updating labels
