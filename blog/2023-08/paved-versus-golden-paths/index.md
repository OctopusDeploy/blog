If you are following the Platform Engineering trend, you'll have heard people talking about paved paths and golden paths. They are sometimes used synonymously, but they are very different concepts.

The idea behind a paved path is that you wait for a route to be worn before laying paving stones. This can be effective way of determining where paths should be placed across an urban park without attempting to analyze where people might be coming from and going to. There are also dangers to this approach, as [Sam Walter Foss warned](https://poets.org/poem/calf-path) in 1895. If you build a platform by encoding the current practice within your internal developer platform, all you do is shift the pain to the platform team.

The concept for your internal developer platform should start with an understanding of developer pain. Once you know the things getting in their way, you can build a platform that makes their job more satisfying. 

In Platform Engineering, the golden paths are a route towards alignment. Say you have five teams all using a different continuous integration tool. As a platform engineer, you'd work out the best way to build, test, and package all the software and provide this as a golden path. It needs to be better than what they currently do and easy to adopt, as you can't force it on a team. The teams that adopt the golden path have an easy life as far as their continuous integration activities are concerned and this is how you convince the other teams to eventually opt in.


Happy deployments!
