This post is the next [in our series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/At%20The%20Helm) chatting to people at Octopus about their role, what they’re working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Kyle Jackson, Security Operations Manager.

## What does the Security Operations team do?

The Security Operations team perform many functions, however we group our work into 2 main categories:

- Internal security
- Product security

Internal security focuses primarily on keeping our employees safe from attacks, and securing the systems our employees use. 

Product security focuses on securing the products our customers use, which includes working with our engineering teams, security researchers on our bug bounty programs, and communicating product vulnerabilities to our customers.

## What keeps you busy every day as Security Operations Manager?

Every day is different, which is one of things I like about working in security operations.

A big part of a typical day as Security Operations Manager is being an escalation point for the other Security Operations team members, working with other teams on their upcoming or in progress projects, and general house keeping.

Although the days are varied, something that's always consistent is multiple meetings!

## What are some of the biggest security threats and how do you manage them?

Being a software vendor, our biggest security threats gravitate around our product. However, we still have internal systems to support the business and these attract their own threats too.

When it comes to managing our product threats, it's a very collaborative process between the Security Operations team and the engineering teams. Collaborating is important so that engineering teams are aware of current and emerging threats and the Security Operations team is aware of new features being worked on which could attract new threats.

For our internal systems, we rely heavily on identity and network segregation to mitigate threats implementing an almost zero-trust architecture. The key, however, is continuously reviewing our threats and the controls we implemented to mitigate those threats.

## What drew you to work in security operations?

I didn't plan to work in security, I kind of fell into it. I was working as a consultant primarily on public cloud security and identity management and I was performing a lot of security incident responses. I left consulting to join Octopus Deploy as one of the first full time security employees in the company.

## How do you plan for the future of Octopus Deploy’s security?

It's a very collaborative process that involves understanding what the product teams are planning on shipping to our customers, what the compliance needs of the business are going to be, where the general security industry trends are heading, and what new threats are being identified that might impact Octopus Deploy.

It takes a lot of time to gather information and plan for the future of Octopus Deploy's security, but it's also important our team is agile and can adjust course if new threats emerge or existing threats change.

## How do you unwind from your job?

Working in Security Operations is a hard job to unwind from as everything moves so quickly, so I tend to spend time out of work hours keeping up with the latest information.

However, I've found the key to unwinding is going to do something but leaving my phone and laptop behind, as it's the only sure way to disconnect.
