This post is the next [in our series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/At%20The%20Helm), chatting to people at Octopus about their role, what they’re working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Kyle Jackson, Security Operations Manager.

## What does the Security Operations team do?

The Security Operations team performs a lot of functions in Octopus Deploy however we group our work into two main categories being internal security and product security.

Internal security we focus primarily on keeping our employees safe from attack as well a securing the systems our employees use. Product security we focus on securing the products our customers use which includes working with our engineering teams, security researchers on our bug bounty programs and communicating product vulnerabilities with our customers.

## What keeps you busy every day as Security Operations Manager?

Every day is always different which is one of things I like about working in security operations.

A big part of a typical day as the Security Operations Manager is being an escalation point for the other Securty Operations team members, working with other teams on their upcoming or in progress projects and general house keeping.

Although the days are varied there is always the one consistent event and that is multiple meetings!

## What are some of the biggest security threats and how do you manage them?

Being a software vendor our biggest security threats generally gravitate around our product(s). However, we still have internal systems to support the business so these also attract their own threats as well.

When it comes to our products and managing threats it is very much a collaborative process between the Security Operations team and the engineering teams. It is important that there is collaboration between the teams to ensure that engineering teams are aware of current and emerging threats and that the Security Operations team knows what new features are being worked on which could attract new threats.

For our internal systems we rely heavily on identity and network segragtion to mitigate threats implementing an almost Zero-trust architecture. Although the key to manage threats is to continusouly review your threats and the controls that have been implemented to mitigate those threats.

## What drew you to work in security operations?

I never really planned to work in security I kind of fell into it. I had been working as a consultant primarily on public cloud security and identity management 
during which I was performing a lot of security incident response. I ended up leaving consultating to join Octopus Deploy as one of the first full time security employees in the company.

## How do you plan for the future of Octopus Deploy’s security?

It is a very collabrative process that involves understanding what the product teams are planning on shipping to our customers, what the compliance needs of the business is going to be and also what are the general security industry trends and what new threats are being identified that may impact Octopus Deploy.

Although a lot of information goes into the planning for the future of Octopus Deploy's security it is also important to have agility within the team to adjust course if new threats emerge or existing threats change.

## How do you unwind from your job?

I have found working in Security Operations to be harder job to unwind from as everything moves so quickly you tend to spend a lot of time out of work hours keeping up with the latest information.

However, the key to unwinding is going to do something but leaving your phone/laptop behind as it is the only sure way to disconnect.
