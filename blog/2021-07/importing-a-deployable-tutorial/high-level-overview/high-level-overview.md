Welcome!

If you are reading this, then you have successfully deployed your first application through Octopus Deploy! This overview is meant to provide some additional context and information as well as point you in the right direction to getting the most out of Octopus Deploy.

## What is Octopus Deploy and who is it for?

Octopus Deploy was founded in 2012 to create happy deployments, and by extension, happy software teams. Octopus Deploy focuses on three main parts of continuous delivery: Deploy, Release and Operate. The Octopus Deploy product helps to automate deployments, safeguard their deployments for release, and automate the tasks required outside the deployment window.

Octopus Deploy follows a bottom-up approach, meaning our product is targeted at the software engineering teams using the product. We find that a developer-led adoption model means that the product is targeted at the end users who then convince decision makers to adpopt the product company wide.

Octopus Deploy is meant to be used by medium to large sized companies. Typically a company with 200 or more employees is the tipping point as it is large enough to warrant a complex deployment setup for Octopus Deploy to help with.

### What have I learned?

In this tutorial, you have imported and exported project and deployed a package to an Azure web application where this article is now hosted. Through setting up this page, you have been exposed to some of the fundamental concepts of Octopus Deploy such as:

 - Deployment targets
 - Environments
 - Accounts
 - Packaging applications
 - Projects
 - Releases
 - Deployments
 - Workers
 - Runbooks

The blog post represented a simple example. Production level solutions are more complex with many deployment steps and deployment targets. Ther are also other advanced Octopus Deploy features such as tenants and the Octopus REST API that developers can use. A comprehensive documentation of all Octopus Deploy features is found [here](https://octopus.com/docs)
