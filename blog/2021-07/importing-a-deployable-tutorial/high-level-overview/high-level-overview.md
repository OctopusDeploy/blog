## Welcome!

Well done! You have deployed your first application with Octopus Deploy! This overview provides some additional context and information about Octopus Deploy. It will also point you in the right direction to learn more.

## What is Octopus Deploy and who is it for?

Octopus Deploy began in 2012 to create happy deployments, and by extension, happy software teams. Octopus Deploy focuses on three main parts of continuous delivery: Deploy, Release and Operate.

Octopus Deploy sits in the middle of the CI/CD toolchain, acting as an orchestrator. This orchestration requires several software integrations from coding frameworks to cloud providers. Octopus Deploy chooses to do a smaller number of things at high quality, over doing everything. By focussing on orchestration and enabling these integrations, Octopus enables best-in-class tooling. See our custom tutorial builder that builds [tutorials for your CI/CD stack.](https://octopus.com/docs/guides)

## What have I learned?

You have imported an exported project and deployed a package to an Azure web application. You have learned some of the fundamental concepts of Octopus Deploy, such as:

 - deployment targets
 - environments
 - accounts
 - packaging applications
 - projects
 - releases
 - deployments

The blog post represented a simple example. Production level solutions are more complex, with many deployment steps and deployment targets. There are other advanced Octopus Deploy features that developers can use. These include tenants, the Octopus REST API, and more. See comprehensive documentation of all Octopus Deploy [features](https://octopus.com/docs).

## How does this help me?

You are now able to use the Octopus Deploy platform for continuous deployment. We have a wide range of example use cases for customers that have used Octopus Deploy. Some or a mixture of these likely apply to you. Read more about specific [use cases](https://octopus.com/company/customers).

This page provides further resources to help you get the most out of Octopus Deploy.

## Where can I learn more?
