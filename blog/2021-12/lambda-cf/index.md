Lambda is a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) offering from AWS. Lambda's provide native scaling, high availability, and the ability to scale to 0 to keep costs down for infrequently used deployments.

Like most AWS resources, Lambdas can be placed in a VPC to colocate it with other resources like databases or EC2 instances.

In this post you'll deploy a simple Lmabda, and then build on the [VPC with private and public subnets example provided in a previous post](https://octopus.com/blog/aws-vpc-public-private) to deploy a Lambda in a VPC with internet access using CloudFormation.

## A simple Lambda CloudFormation template

Deploying a Lambda can be as simple as creating a log group to capture the Lambda's output, granting a Lambda access to the log group through a IAM role, and then defining the Lambda itself. An example template deploying these resources is shown below:

```yaml
Parameters:
  Tag:
    Type: String
  LambdaS3Bucket:
    Type: String
  LambdaS3Key:
    Type: String
  LambdaName:
    Type: String
    
Resources: 
  AppLogGroup:
    Type: "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Sub "/aws/lambda/${LambdaName}"
      
  IamRoleLambdaExecution:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      Path: "/"
      RoleName: !Sub "${LambdaName}-role"  
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
        - Effect: "Allow"
          Principal:
            Service:
            - "lambda.amazonaws.com"
          Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
      ManagedPolicyArns: 
      - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole"
      Policies:
      - PolicyName: !Sub "${LambdaName}-policy"
        PolicyDocument:
          Version: "2012-10-17"
          Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Action:
            - "logs:CreateLogStream"
            - "logs:CreateLogGroup"
            - "logs:PutLogEvents"
            Resource:
            - !Sub "arn:${AWS::Partition}:logs:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:log-group:/aws/lambda/${LambdaName}*:*"
        
  MyLambda:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
    Properties:
        Code:
          S3Bucket: !Ref "LambdaS3Bucket"
          S3Key: !Ref "LambdaS3Key"
        Description: "My Lambda"
        FunctionName: !Ref "LambdaName"
        Handler: "not.used.in.provided.runtime"
        MemorySize: 256
        PackageType: "Zip"
        Role: !GetAtt "IamRoleLambdaExecution.Arn"
        Runtime: "provided"
        Timeout: 30
```

The logs generated by the Lambda are placed in a new log group, represented by the [AWS::Logs::LogGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-loggroup.html) resource:

```yaml
  AppLogGroup:
    Type: "AWS::Logs::LogGroup"
    Properties:
      LogGroupName: !Sub "/aws/lambda/${LambdaName}"
```

To grant the Lambda permission to write to the log group create above, you must create a new IAM role able to be assumed by a Lambda and which includes the permissions to write to the log group:

```yaml
  IamRoleLambdaExecution:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      Path: "/"
      RoleName: !Sub "${LambdaName}-role"  
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
        - Effect: "Allow"
          Principal:
            Service:
            - "lambda.amazonaws.com"
          Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
      ManagedPolicyArns: 
      - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole"
      Policies:
      - PolicyName: !Sub "${LambdaName}-policy"
        PolicyDocument:
          Version: "2012-10-17"
          Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Action:
            - "logs:CreateLogStream"
            - "logs:CreateLogGroup"
            - "logs:PutLogEvents"
            Resource:
            - !Sub "arn:${AWS::Partition}:logs:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:log-group:/aws/lambda/${LambdaName}*:*"
  ```

The final step is to create the Lambda itself, represented by the [AWS::Lambda::Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html) resource.

Lambdas deploy code that has been uploaded to an S3 bucket. Uploading files is not performed by CloudFormation, so this must be performed as a separate step prior to deploying the template.

The example Lambda below is configured to deploy a natively compiled binary, usually written in a language like Go or using a compiler like GraalVM.

Other languages, like Java, DotNET Core, Python, PHP, Node.js etc, require their own [unique runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html), and this affects the [`Runtime`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html#cfn-lambda-function-runtime) and [`Handler`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html#cfn-lambda-function-handler) properties in the CloudFormation template:

  ```yaml
  MyLambda:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
    Properties:
        Code:
          S3Bucket: !Ref "LambdaS3Bucket"
          S3Key: !Ref "LambdaS3Key"
        Description: "My Lambda"
        FunctionName: !Ref "LambdaName"
        Handler: "not.used.in.provided.runtime"
        MemorySize: 256
        PackageType: "Zip"
        Role: !GetAtt "IamRoleLambdaExecution.Arn"
        Runtime: "provided"
        Timeout: 30
  ```

## Placing a Lambda in a VPC

In a more complex scenario, your Lambda will be granted access to a VPC in order to access shared resources like a database or EC2 instance.

The template below builds on a previous example demonstrating a VPC with a mix of [public and private subnets](https://octopus.com/blog/aws-vpc-public-private), and then deploys a Lambda with [VPC access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html):

The majority of this template defines the resources required to build a VPC with both a private and public subnet, as well as building the network infrastructure like internet gateways and NAT gateways to provide internet access to any other resources placed in the VPC subnets. These resources are covered in detail in a [previous post](https://octopus.com/blog/aws-vpc-public-private).

You then create a security group, represented by the [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) resource, to define the networking rules applied to resources in this VPC. This example includes rules that allow all outbound traffic:

```yaml
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupName: "Example Security Group"
      GroupDescription: "Lambda Traffic"
      VpcId: !Ref "VPC"
      SecurityGroupEgress:
      - IpProtocol: "-1"
        CidrIp: "0.0.0.0/0"
```

Resources that share the security group are allowed to communicate with each other using the following security group ingress rule, represented by the [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group-ingress.html) resource. This allows related resources access to each other without requiring them to have known IP addresses or be placed in special CIDR blocks:

```yaml
  InstanceSecurityGroupIngress:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress"
    DependsOn: "InstanceSecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupId: !Ref "InstanceSecurityGroup"
      IpProtocol: "tcp"
      FromPort: "0"
      ToPort: "65535"
      SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref "InstanceSecurityGroup"
```

The log group and IAM role are the same as the simple example described at the start of this post.

The Lambda is changed slightly to include a new `VPCConfig` property granting the Lambda access to resources inside the VPC:

```yaml
  MyLambda:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
    Properties:
        Code:
          S3Bucket: !Ref "LambdaS3Bucket"
          S3Key: !Ref "LambdaS3Key"
        Description: "My Lambda"
        FunctionName: !Ref "LambdaName"
        Handler: "not.used.in.provided.runtime"
        MemorySize: 256
        PackageType: "Zip"
        Role: !GetAtt "IamRoleLambdaExecution.Arn"
        Runtime: "provided"
        Timeout: 30
        VpcConfig:
            SecurityGroupIds:
            - !Ref "InstanceSecurityGroup"
            SubnetIds:
            - !Ref "SubnetB"
            - !Ref "SubnetC"
```

## Conclusion

Lambdas can be quite simple to deploy, requiring a small number of supporting resources like log groups and IAM roles to allow the Lambda to be monitored and debugged.

For more complex scenarios where Lambdas must have access to other resources like databases or EC2 instances inside a VPC, Lambdas can be configured with network access to specified subnets and have network traffic controlled using security groups.

In this post you learned how to perform a simple Lambda deployment, and then saw an more complex example that built a VPC alongside the Lambda.
