This year at Octopus, we hosted webinars on a wide variety of topics. Hosting webinars is a fun way to share our knowledge and deep dive into topics for our customers and the broader DevOps community. 

In this post, I share our favorite and most popular webinars to keep you company if you're working through the holiday period.

You can find all 55 of our webinars on our YouTube [Webinars playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGskdGvlaw2ph_YPvMquJlzgYd7bEDba).

## Technical deep dive into Config as Code

[Configuration as Code](https://octopus.com/blog/config-as-code-what-is-it-how-is-it-beneficial) has been an Octopus concept for a while. Config as code allows you to store your scripts in source control and run them on your deployment targets or Workers. 

In 2021, we launched Config as Code as an early access preview, giving you built-in support for Config as Code with Git. In this webinar, we started a project from scratch using Config as Code and talked you through using this new feature.

We covered the following topics: 

- What is Config as Code and how to use it
- How to set up your first project in Octopus using Config as Code
- How Config as Code helps your team work where they’re most effective, whether that’s in the Octopus UI or the project’s GitHub repo

## Continuous Delivery with Dave Farley: Using fast feedback to get high quality releases

[Continuous Delivery](https://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk/) is well established in modern development teams, however, no two teams do it the same way. A key benefit of shipping software regularly is the feedback loop that leads to high-quality releases. Most teams are doing this to some extent, but how can you maximize this?

In this webinar, Bob Walker and Dave Farley, consultant and co-author of Continuous Delivery, discussed how to get the most out of your CI/CD pipelines and optimize for fast feedback that results in high-quality releases.

We covered the following topics: 

- The fundamentals of Continuous Delivery
- Common problems that can impact the feedback cycle
- Tips to optimize your CI/CD pipelines for fast feedback
- Concrete examples of companies actively applying this

## Getting started with Database DevOps

Very few people enjoy executing manual deployments, especially database deployments.  However, many people still do their database deployments manually.  Most people agree this is a problem, but how can we solve it?  Is DevOps the answer?

In this webinar, we demonstrated how to get started with Database DevOps to save time and frustration.  

We covered the following topics:   

- What is DevOps and how can it be applied to the database
- How to get started with Database DevOps 
- Common roadblocks and how to overcome them

## CI/CD in the cloud with Octopus and TeamCity

We launched Octopus Cloud in 2018 and have iterated on it for the past three years. Our favorite build server, [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) (which we use internally at Octopus) now has a cloud product, eliminating the need for local virtual machines on-premises. You can now use both Octopus and TeamCity on fully-managed cloud offerings.

We covered the following topics: 

- How to use TeamCity Cloud
- How to use Octopus Cloud
- How you can integrate both for a fully-managed CI/CD pipeline in the cloud

## Using the Octopus API to save time by automating repetitive tasks

Octopus Deploy is designed as an API-first application meaning anything you can do in the Octopus Web Portal, you can do with the REST API.   

In this webinar, we demonstrated how the Octopus REST API can save you time by automating repetitive tasks. 

We covered the following topics: 

- An overview of the Octopus API and why it’s useful 
- How to manage access with API keys  
- Different ways to make API calls (Octopus.Client, CLI, custom scripts in the language of your choice) 
- How to save time by automating custom or repetitive tasks

## Summary

We ran some world-class webinars in 2021 that we're really proud of. I'm excited about what we're going to do in 2022 with great new people on the team, new features, and interesting things we're aiming to do in the community.

Our pipeline for the first quarter of 2021 is already looking full, but if you have an idea for a webinar you'd like to see, or improvements we can make with our webinars, please email us at [webinars@octopus.com](mailto:webinars@octopus.com).

Happy deployments!
