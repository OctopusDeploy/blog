## Body

The body of the post is where you share your hypothesis, how-to, or story.

### Sub headings

Use three ### to include H3 headings.

Use **Bold** text for UI labels, use single back-ticks for `parameters` and `filepaths`, and three back-ticks for code blocks:

```
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```

Use the following (minus the back-ticks) to include images:

```
![Alt text, a description of the image](/path/to/image.png "width=500")*Optional caption text*
```
If including images, please include alt text. Alt text is primarily used to describe images to people unable to see them, and can be 125 characters max including spaces. You can also include an image caption if the reader would benefit from additional information or context.
