This week we shipped a number of improvements and enhancements to the deployment log. 

The main features are:

- A modern visual design that makes it delightful to read logs
- Performance improvements - handles huge logs (with millions of lines) with ease without freezing
- Intelligent Log Rendering™️ brings the most important events to your attention, even in huge logs

And smaller improvements:

- Line numbering
- Ability to select and link to log lines, and share the link with others
- Clean Copy & Paste™️ without line numbers and other things polluting
- Visual indication of the time different steps took
- Defaulting to showing the task log if a deployment is running
- Better progress indicators so you know what's happening


We hope these improvements will make it easier to find and fix deployment problems. Happy deployments!
