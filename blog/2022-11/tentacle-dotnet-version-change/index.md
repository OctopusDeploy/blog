Due to .NET Framework 4.5.2 being EOL from 26 April 2022 and .NET Core 3.1 being EOL from December 13, 2022, we're moving Tentacle to .NET Framework 4.8 for the Windows installer only, and .NET 6 for everything else including the Windows Docker image.

In this post, I cover why weâ€™re making this decision now. I also cover some questions you might have regarding the Tentacle bump.

## Why are we moving Tentacle now?

Tentacle had been on .NET Framework 4.5.2 and .NET Core 3.1 for some time. We decided to move these versions because .NET Framework 4.5.2 will be EOL from April 26, 2022 and `.NET Core 3.1` will be EOL from December 13, 2022. This means we'll be missing out on security patches and library updates. To continue providing our customers with software that's secure, it's essential we align with the support schedules of our underlying development frameworks.

## What's the plan for Tentacle moving forward?

We're going to compile Tentacle for .NET 6 and .NET Framework 4.8, as there are still many deployment targets using different versions of Windows 7 and 8 (including Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP2) which require a supported .NET version in the short to medium term. The .NET 6 builds of Octopus Tentacle will be used for all other platforms, such as Linux packages and Docker Images.

## Questions you might have

### Do I need to do anything to affect the .NET version change?

You need to do the following if it applies to you:

- If you haven't done so already, install .NET Framework 4.8 on your Windows server operating system.
  - If you're on Windows Server 2022, you can ignore this step as you'll already have .NET Framework 4.8 installed. [Learn more in the Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies#net-framework-48).
- Upgrade your existing Tentacle via the usual methods we support or by using the 2023.1 bundled Tentacle when it becomes available.

### Will my deployments be affected?

No, your deployments won't be affected by this move. By making the incremental move to .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 6, we remain backward compatible for your deployment targets as far back as Windows 7 SP1.

### Should I upgrade deployment targets on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP2?

Yes, we encourage you to upgrade your deployment targets that are still on Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 SP2. We recommend upgrading to a version that supports .NET Framework 4.8, and ideally compatible with .NET 6 and above.

### What if I can't upgrade my deployment targets?

If you can't upgrade your deployment targets to a supported .NET version, you need to lock your Tentacle version to avoid it automatically upgrading. Locking ensures it remains functional for those deployment targets. 

To learn more about locking your Tentacle version, please read [our post about Tentacle versioning](https://octopus.com/blog/tentacle-versioning#lock-on-the-tentacle).

- [.NET Linux Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)

### When will the Windows Installer be upgraded to .NET 6?

We plan to move Tentacle to .NET 6 for the Windows installer early or mid-2023, to give you time to upgrade your deployment targets to a version that supports .NET 6 moving forward.

## Conclusion

We hope this post explains why we're moving Tentacle to .NET Framework 4.8 for the Windows installer only, and .NET 6 for everything else including the Windows Docker image.
