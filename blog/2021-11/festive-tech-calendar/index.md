Octopus Deploy is excited to be part of this year’s [Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com), running a hackathon competition.

## What is the Festive Tech Calendar?

The Festive Tech Calendar is a free, month-long, community-run tech event. People from all tech communities are invited to submit talks, content, and competitions, and participate in the activities.

## The Octopus hackathon

**When**: Wednesday, 1 December - Wednesday, 15 December 2021
**Prize**: One of three Octopus Deploy swag bundles

### Hackathon guidelines

Our guidelines are loose:

- We have no preference on how you configure your deployment or what the web app is
- It doesn’t matter how complex or straightforward your app and process are
- You can build a new web app or use one of the Octopus samples: 
   - [OctoPetShop](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/OctoPetShop)
   - [Random Quotes](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/RandomQuotes)
- You can use technologies that are new to you, or those you’re familiar with, anything from ARM templates, PowerShell, and Terraform, to GitHub Actions and more.

Primarily, we just want you to have fun and learn something!

### How to enter

- Use an existing Azure account or sign up for an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) 
   - If you're signing up for an Azure free account you automatically receive $200 in Azure credits for 30 days and a limited quantity of additional free services for 12 months
- Use an existing Octopus Deploy environment or sign up for an [Octopus Cloud free trial](https://octopus.com/start/cloud)
- Deploy an Azure Web App using Octopus Deploy 
- After completing the hackathon, fill out all required fields in our [hackathon submission form](https://forms.gle/PeGkA92uhnGsHy268) before 5 pm GMT, Wednesday, 15 December 2021.

### Winners

We'll randomly select three winners from the submissions. 

Our winners will receive one of three swag bundles:

We'll announce the winners on or around 2 pm GMT, Monday, 20 December 2021.

### Spreading the community spirit

Feel free to write a blog post, create a video, or tweet about your hackathon implementation, tagging [@OctopusDeploy](https://www.twitter.com/OctopusDeploy); we’d love to hear from you.  

These optional activities don't get you extra credit but will spread some community spirit. 


#### The fine print

- A purchase or payment isn't necessary and doesn't increase your chances of winning. 
- We'll only consider one entry per person. 
- The hackathon is not open to employees, representatives, or agents of Octopus Deploy, including all members of their immediate family or household.
- The hackathon is not open to any other individual involved with the design, production, promotion, execution, or distribution of the hackathon, including all members of their immediate family or household.
- Hackathon submission period:   8 am GMT, 1 December 2021 – 5 pm GMT, 15 December 2021. 
- Winners announced: on or around 2 pm GMT, Monday, 20 December 2021.
