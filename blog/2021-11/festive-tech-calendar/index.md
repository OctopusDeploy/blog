Octopus Deploy is excited to be part of this year’s Festive Tech Calendar and support this tremendous community-run initiative. 

We are running a Hackathon competition from December 1, 2021, until December 15, 2021, where you can win some awesome Octopus Deploy swag!

The Hackathon will focus on Octopus Deploy and Microsoft Azure.  We would love you to deploy an Azure Web App using Octopus Deploy. 

It can be as straightforward or as complex as you’d like; we have no preference on how you configure the deployment or what the web app is. 

You could use one of the Octopus Sample Web Apps like [OctoPetShop](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/OctoPetShop) or [Random Quotes](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/OctoPetShop) or make your own. 

Use ARM Templates, PowerShell, Terraform, GitHub Actions, be as creative as you want.  Pick a new technology or use ones you are already familiar with.  The choice is entirely yours. As long as you have successfully deployed an Azure Web App using Octopus Deploy at the end of the Hackathon, you will have completed the Hackathon! 

We want you to have fun, learn something during this Hackathon.  

Once you’ve completed the Hackathon exercise, head over to our [submission page](https://forms.gle/PeGkA92uhnGsHy268) and let us know; before December 15, 2021 (5:00 pm Greenwich Mean Time). We’ll be randomly picking three winners from the submissions. We have three swag bundles to give away:

We will announce the winners On or around December 20, 2021 (2:00 pm Greenwich Mean Time). 

Please feel free to write a blog post, or create a video, or tweet about your Hackathon implementation and be sure to tag [@OctopusDeploy](https://www.twitter.com/OctopusDeploy); we’d love to hear from you.  This part is optional and doesn’t get you extra credit, but it will spread some community spirit. 

## Getting started with Octopus Deploy
If you’ve never used Octopus Deploy before, we have great [Getting Started Docs](https://octopus.com/docs/getting-started) or [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGskdGvlaw268i2ZTPC1ZrxwFjjKIdKH). We also have a [Community Slack space](http://octopususergroup.slack.com) to ask questions and meet other people from the Octopus community.
