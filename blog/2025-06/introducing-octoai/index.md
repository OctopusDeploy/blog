DevOps teams have embraced GenAI for many of their tasks, notably to assist with writing code, but also for other common tasks like pull request comments, documentation, debugging error messages, and more.

A question we have been exploring in Octopus is how GenAI can meaningfully improve the delivery of software. GenAI is incredibly powerful, but also has the unfortunate distinction of being "slapped on" to products in ways that add little value. So is there an opportunity to integrate GenAI with Octopus in a way that delivers genuine value to our users?

In this post I'll discuss how we plan to streamline and improve the software delivery process with GenAI, and how we plan to integrate it into Octopus.

## What is the problem we are trying to solve?

Are you part of a software company? It seems like an obvious question, and one that is straightforward to answer if your company sells software or technical services. But what about a bank, insurance provider, hospital, school, supermarket, or government agency? Many of these organizations don't think of themselves as software companies.

The way to determine if you are a software company is to ask yourself: "What would happen if all the computers were turned off?"

If the answer is that your business would grind to a halt, then you are a software company. If you are a software company, then you need to deliver software to your employees and users.

DevOps teams are responsible for keeping software companies running. It is a complex job, and it will only ever get more complex. And the reality is this complexity is always going to be met with the demand to do more with less.

When you look at the metrics used to measure DevOps performance, such as DORA metrics, you will see that every one of them measures some aspect of a production deployment:

* Deployment Frequency is a direct measurement of production deployment frequency
* Mean Lead Time for Changes measures the time it takes to get changes into production
* Mean Time to Restore measures how quickly a change can be made in production to restore service
* Change Failure Rate measures how many production deployments introduce failures

Anything that prevents a DevOps team from delivering software to production reduces their performance. There is simply no way to be a high-performing DevOps team without delivering software to production.

This is the problem we are trying to solve: how do we remove the barriers to delivering software to production? Because this is the foundation of high-performing DevOps teams, and every software company demands high-performing DevOps teams.
