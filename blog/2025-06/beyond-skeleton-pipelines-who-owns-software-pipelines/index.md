title: "Beyond skeleton pipelines: who owns your software pipeline?"

Your current software delivery processes are probably working fine. They build your code, maybe run a test or two, and get your software to production. That's no small achievement, but here's a question that might make you pause.

When did someone last spend time improving them?

If you're like many software teams I've worked with, the answer is probably "not recently". Maybe not ever.

I've worked with developer teams at different maturity levels and have repeatedly seen this pattern. Great development teams who are busy building software but aren't large enough to have platform teams or dedicated operational folk responsible for the software delivery process. They typically start with a template from their cloud provider, delivery tooling vendor, or, these days, their favorite AI LLM. Initially, it gets the job done, but I refer to these as skeleton pipelines—the bare minimum framework to ship code.

Skeleton pipelines are a great starting point. They get you from nothing to shipping code quickly, but your pipelines are living, breathing artifacts. Before long, they need some meat added to the skeleton to provide functionality beyond the basics and make your delivery process robust and delightful.

I've seen when teams experience friction with their software release process, but don't treat it as a bug or feature improvement that needs to be logged, prioritized, and worked on. If your deployment pipelines are responsible for delivering your product to customers, shouldn't you treat them as part of your product? When was the last time someone added a pipeline improvement to your backlog or spent time making your deployment process better?

The important shift is treating delivery process improvements as regular development work, not spare-time projects that inevitably get pushed aside.

## The ownership vacuum

Ask any group of engineers, "Who owns your software delivery pipelines?" and I bet you'll get different answers. When writing this post, I put that question into a search engine and reviewed the discussions, which weren't surprising. Some say developers should own what they build, others insist it's up to platform or DevOps engineers. Then there's the view that everyone is responsible because DevOps is about everyone working together. My observation is that often, no one owns it, and that's when it becomes a problem.

The distinction that matters isn't really about ownership. It's about accountability. Someone needs to be accountable for ensuring your delivery process evolves, improves, and supports your organization with shipping software rather than being a friction-filled process people loathe working with. Without that accountability, pipelines can easily become unmanaged components that gradually deteriorate until they become technical debt and a bottleneck instead of an enabler.

There's no one-size-fits-all answer for who should own and be accountable for your pipelines. You must discuss and agree based on your maturity, size, team structure, and individual skill sets. The important thing is that it is discussed and agreed upon, and not left to assumptions. Ask yourself now if everyone on the team knows how and where to raise an issue with the deployment process today. If the answer is no, then start there. Determine who's responsible and establish clear channels for pipeline feedback, problems, and improvements.

## The cost of skeleton pipelines

This ownership vacuum creates predictable problems I've seen many times. Teams fall into the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, leaving pipelines as-is for months or years. The issue is that what worked well 6, 12, or 18 months ago likely isn't fit for purpose today. New tooling and techniques exist now that didn't then. Your team will likely ship more frequently—or at least want to—and handle more complex deployments than when you first created that pipeline. The infrastructure you're deploying to has likely changed. Different developers and engineers might work at your company who didn't before. You're missing out on tooling and practices that could: 

- Save weekly hours
- Bring new functionality to your software delivery lifecycle that adds business value
- Catch issues before they become customer problems

Worse, they often become single points of knowledge. Whoever initially sets up the pipeline is the only person who understands how it works. When that person leaves or gets pulled onto other projects, your team inherits a mysterious system everyone fears touching.

Fragile pipelines break at the worst possible moments. They miss opportunities to catch issues early, optimize build times, have predictable outcomes, or provide better feedback to developers. Maybe, most importantly, they frustrate your team and slow down what they're supposed to enable: shipping great software and products.

## You can't afford to ignore this

"We're too busy building features to worry about pipeline improvements." Sound familiar? It's a common pushback I hear from teams, and I get it. When trying to ship products and keep customers happy, spending time on what feels like an internal process is often considered a luxury you can't afford.

Platform teams are getting a lot of attention lately, and for good reason, as they work well for larger organizations. But if your company doesn't need everything else a platform team typically handles, creating one just for pipeline ownership is unnecessary. The reality is that you don't need a dedicated platform team to own your pipelines. You can borrow their mindset by treating your delivery process as part of your product. Pipeline improvements get backlog items, performance issues get bug tickets, and deployment pain points get the same attention as user-reported problems.

Start by paying attention to where your process hurts. If deployments make you nervous, your team loathes "release day", when releases fail for mysterious reasons or when you're manually testing things your team can automate. These pain points are your roadmap for high-value improvements.

## Making the investment

Improvements may include: 

- Adding vulnerability scanning during builds
- Configuring integration tests against ephemeral infrastructure
- Properly storing and versioning your deployment artifacts
- Implementing flexible approval workflows
- Creating a robust deployment strategy
- Measuring deployment metrics

I'm not giving you a shopping list of things to do. Instead, I recognize that "you don't know what you don't know" because I've been there too, and you may be experiencing issues you didn't know there were solutions to.

We have a white paper titled [The ten pillars of pragmatic deployments](https://octopus.com/whitepapers/ten-pillars-of-pragmatic-deployments). I bring this to your attention not for a checklist of everything you should do but for insight into what we think good deployments look like based on years of experience building a deployment automation tool. The ideas discussed in this post might help you enhance your software delivery process today or provide insight into issues and solutions you may not have been aware of.

## Take ownership

It's easy to overlook software delivery pipelines. They're usually out of sight until they get in your way, kind of like plumbing. It's invisible when it works and catastrophic when it doesn't. Excellent plumbing supports everything in your house to function smoothly, and great delivery processes do the same for your product development.

Claim ownership of your software delivery processes and ensure someone is accountable for their care and feeding. Talk to your engineers involved in developing and releasing software, and find out where the pain is. Implement easy-to-use feedback loops, add pipeline improvements to your backlog, and treat deployment pain points as bugs worth investing in and fixing.

Your future self and team will thank you when your next deployment goes smoothly instead of keeping everyone up after hours or nervously huddling around a few pizzas doing your monthly release with crossed fingers.

Happy deployments!
