Being able to see where a variable is used has been a very common feature request for **Octopus Deploy**. In this blog post, we will explore some of the issues involved with delivering such a feature.

## Why variable usage?

There are a number of use cases for being able to see variable usage:

- Determining the purpose of a variable. It may not be obvious from the variable name.
- Changing a variable‚Äôs value. Identifying where a variable is used would help determine the impact of a value change and whether it is safe to change.
- Deleting unused variables. Being able to identify all potential variable usages would help determine if the variable is unused and can safely be deleted.

These use cases are concerned with *if* and *where* the values of variables are actually used. For the last two use cases, it is very important that *all* potential usages are identified.

Related use cases:

- Identifying duplicate variables (by name or by value). This would allow duplicate variables to be extracted into a library variable set and shared between the projects that use them.
- Identifying clashing scope issues, e.g. indeterministic results, missing values for an environment in the lifecycle etc.
- Identifying plain text variables that should be sensitive, e.g. variable names containing ‚Äòpassword‚Äô,  ‚Äòpwd‚Äô, ‚Äòtoken‚Äô or ‚Äòapikey‚Äô or containing values that look like API keys etc. and suggesting they be changed to sensitive.

These use cases are concerned with what variables *exist* and what their *values* are. They are not concerned with exactly where they are used, i.e. usage. While there certainly may be value in supporting these use cases, we won‚Äôt consider them here as they are not directly related to variable *usage*.

Let‚Äôs have a look at how variable usages might be found and some of the problems that will be encountered along the way.

## Static search

This would use the current API to gather information about places where variables are used. Project variables and library variable sets can be searched. The following usages can be determined using the current API:

- Variable values.
- Step parameters in either the project‚Äôs deployment process or any runbooks.
- Usages in step scripts.

Even just looking at variable values, we already run into problems trying to find all the usages. At first glance, it should be easy to look for variable usages in variable values - just search for `#{variablename}`. However, variable values can be defined using [Octostache](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Octostache) expressions, which is the variable substitution syntax for **Octopus Deploy**. **Octostache** expressions are very flexible and allow for some weird and wonderful edge cases, particularly when the [extended syntax](https://octopus.com/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions) is used. As an example, consider these variables and their values:

|  Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `Greeting.English` | `Hello` |
| `Greeting.MƒÅori` | `Kia ora` |
| `Language` | `English` |
| `Greeting` | `#{Greeting.#{Language}}` |

In this example, there would be no easy way to determine that the `Greeting.English` variable is used. Step properties also support **Octostache** expressions and so have the same problem.

There are numerous other types of **Octostache** expressions that would trip up any attempt to find variable usages. **Octostache** expressions are fantastic in that they allow for very flexible and creative ways to use variables, but the downside is that they make it impossible to find all variable usages.

Variable usages in step scripts (e.g. the ‚ÄòInline Source Code‚Äô property of a ‚ÄòRun A Script‚Äô step) can also cause problems. Variable names can be almost anything and can be accessed dynamically. For example, we have the following variable names:

- `*(_ü§¶_*(& KL" P{}$^[p]'!`  (yes, this really is a valid variable name)
- `FrankieSay"Relax"`
- `PowerMax`

And this PowerShell script:

``` PowerShell
# *(_ü§¶_*(& KL" P{}$^[p]'! is a silly variable name.
Write-Host $OctopusParameters["FrankieSay""Relax"""]
$powerLevel = 'Max'
Write-Host $OctopusParameters["Power" + $powerLevel]
```

Doing a straight text search for variable names will generate a false positive for `*(_ü§¶_*(& KL" P{}$^[p]'!` because it is in a comment. It would also miss `FrankieSay"Relax"` and `PowerMax` because they are referenced by a name that is generated at runtime. It may be possible to use a smarter search to deal with some of the issues above, but like **Octostache** expressions, there are numerous (perhaps endless) other variations that would also cause problems. Trying to catch them all would be impossible.

## Other static searching options

Currently, if a project has been version controlled using Config as Code, the deployment process will be defined in text files. The intention is to add variables themselves and runbooks to Config as Code in the near future, which will mean that they will also be stored in text files. When that happens, finding variable usages (subject to the above limitations) will be as simple as doing a text search in any text editor.

Another option that will work for non-version controlled projects is to use a PowerShell script to query the current API and search for usages. An example script is below. It will only search for usages of project variables, although could be extended to include library variable sets. It also only does a straight text search, so is subject to all the limitations discussed above and certainly is not guaranteed to find all variable usages.

``` PowerShell
$octopusURL = "http://yourinstance.octopus.app"
$octopusAPIKey = "API-Key"
$spaceName = "Default"

# Set up
$usages = @()
$header = @{ "X-Octopus-ApiKey" = $octopusAPIKey }
$space = (Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$octopusURL/api/spaces/all" -Headers $header) | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $spaceName }
$projects = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$octopusURL/api/$($space.Id)/projects/all" -Headers $header

foreach ($project in $projects) {
    # Get project variables
    $projectVariableSet = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$octopusURL/api/$($space.Id)/variables/$($project.VariableSetId)" -Headers $header
    $variableNames = ($projectVariableSet.Variables).Name | Sort-Object -Unique

    foreach ($variableName in $variableNames) {
        $escapedVariableName = $variableName -replace '[\[]', '`$&'
        foreach ($sourceVariable in $projectVariableSet.Variables) {
            if ($sourceVariable.Value -like "*#{$escapedVariableName}*") {
                $usages += [pscustomobject]@{
                    Project  = $project.Name
                    Variable = $variableName
                    Source   = "Project variable value, Project variable: $($sourceVariable.Name)"
                    Usage    = $sourceVariable.Value
                    Link     = "$octopusURL$($project.Links.Web)/variables"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    # Get project deployment process
    $url = "$octopusURL/api/$($space.Id)/deploymentprocesses/$($project.DeploymentProcessId)"
    $steps = (Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $url -Headers $header).Steps

    foreach ($step in $steps) {
        foreach ($variableName in $variableNames) {
            $escapedVariableName = $variableName -replace '[\[]', '`$&'
            $properties = $step.Actions.Properties | Get-Member | Where-Object { $_.MemberType -eq "NoteProperty" -and $_.Definition -like "*$escapedVariableName*" }
            foreach ($property in $properties) {
                $usages += [pscustomobject]@{
                    Project  = $project.Name
                    Variable = $variableName
                    Source   = "Deployment process, Step: $($step.Name), Property: $($property.Name)"
                    Usage    = $property.Definition
                    Link     = "$octopusURL$($project.Links.Web)/deployments/process/steps?actionId=$($step.Actions[0].Id)"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    $url = "$octopusURL/api/$($space.Id)/projects/$($project.Id)/runbooks"
    $runbooks = (Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $url -Headers $header).Items

    foreach ($runbook in $runbooks) {
        Write-Host $runbook.Name

        $url = "$octopusURL/api/$($space.Id)/runbookProcesses/$($runbook.RunbookProcessId)"
        $steps = (Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $url -Headers $header).Steps

        foreach ($step in $steps) {
            foreach ($variableName in $variableNames) {
                $escapedVariableName = $variableName -replace '[\[]', '`$&'
                $properties = $step.Actions.Properties | Get-Member | Where-Object { $_.MemberType -eq "NoteProperty" -and $_.Definition -like "*$escapedVariableName*" }
                foreach ($property in $properties) {
                    $usages += [pscustomobject]@{
                        Project  = $project.Name
                        Variable = $variableName
                        Source   = "Runbook: $($runbook.Name), Step: $($step.Name), Property: $($property.Name)"
                        Usage    = $property.Definition
                        Link     = "$octopusURL$($project.Links.Web)/operations/runbooks/$($runbook.Id)/process/$($runbook.RunbookProcessId)/steps?actionId=$($step.Id)"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

$usages | Sort-Object "Project", "Variable", "Source"  | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

## Deployment-time search

This type of search would capture variable usages as they happen during a deployment. There are three features that are available in all deployment steps that can use variables to perform various types of replacements:

- Structured Configuration Variables
- .NET Configuration Variables
- Substitute Variables in Templates

When these replacements are done, any matches could be sent back to the Octopus Server and stored. One advantage of this approach is that it can capture replacements in files that are sourced from outside of **Octopus Deploy**. Building the infrastructure into **Octopus Deploy** to support this type of search would not be straight forward.

There are some interesting questions as to how exactly this type of search would work. Steps can be conditional and may only execute during a production deployment for example. It therefore may require multiple deployments to capture all variable usages. Should **Octopus Deploy** try to capture variable usages from multiple deployments and somehow collate them? At what point should they be ‚Äòreset‚Äô? How could a user be confident that usages from all possible deployment types have been captured?

Ultimately, no matter how this feature would be implemented, it will require careful setup and input from the user to capture usages. It certainly wouldn't be a straightforward single click to get all the usages.

## Conclusion

A static search and deployment-time search would both capture different types of variable usages. Neither can be guaranteed to capture all usages, but they would capture most usages in most circumstances. Missed usages would mostly be where variables are being used in unusual or ‚Äòcreative‚Äô ways.

The question now becomes should we build this? Is there enough value in a feature that will *probably* work *most* of the time? To be confident that a variable really is unused and can safely be removed, *all* variable usages need to be identified - something that can not be guaranteed. Even if this limitation is made very clear in the UI, it is inevitable that some users will get caught out.

As the deployment-time search would require a significant effort to build and would not be straightforward to use, should we just build the static search? Seems like it would be a ‚Äòhalf solution‚Äô. How much value would there be in adding just a static search to the UI when the same functionality can be achieved right now with a PowerShell script?
