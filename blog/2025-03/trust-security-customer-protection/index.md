Our top priority at Octopus Deploy is ensuring our customers can deploy safely and securely. We're proud that 4000+ customers [trust us](https://octopus.com/company/trust) and our products to deliver their changes into production. We take that responsibility seriously, and our [security guiding principles](https://octopus.com/security/disclosure) prioritize our customers' security interests over ours.

In this post, I walk you through our most recent product security updates.

## Product security enhancements 

We’re happy to announce improvements to the Octopus Server in 2025.1, which have already rolled out to Octopus Cloud customers. We made changes to our encryption support across data at rest and in transit. These changes provide you with enhanced security, lower network latency, and the potential for improved operational efficiency.

The changes include:

- Using AES-256 by default for Master Key encryption of sensitive data in the Octopus database for all new server instances.
- Adding TLS 1.3 support to Octopus Server and Octopus Cloud for the Octopus Tentacle communication channel.

## Security and compliance programs

We're dedicated to maintaining and continuously improving our security and compliance programs alongside [continued product improvements](https://roadmap.octopus.com). We undergo regular third-party audits and technical assessments of our data security to ensure privacy and safety.

Our security credentials include:

- SOC 2 Type II: This demonstrates the robustness of our controls around security, privacy, availability, and confidentiality in Octopus. It reflects our commitment to earning and maintaining customer trust in our product and service.
- ISO 27001:2013: This certifies that Octopus’s information security management system meets industry-standard requirements for protecting customers’ information.

## Conclusion

At Octopus, security is everybody's business. We're continuously making product improvements to meet the security needs of our customers. We're also dedicated to security and compliance programs. We pride ourselves on making Octopus a secure product for our customers.

Happy deployments!
