If you’ve ever gone through a website re-design, you know it’s a lot like refactoring old code- you start out with full confidence “This should be an easy fix” and before you know it, you’re knee-deep in overhaul and questioning every choice that got you here. Our careers page revamp was no different. How was our careers page before? It was fine- functional, informative, and technically accurate. But with the evolution of Octopus over the last few years it just wasn’t quite us. What was next? Doing exactly what any DevOps team would do when faced with legacy infrastructure- we rebuilt it.

## Why Overhaul?

A Talent Team should think of their careers page as far more than just a list of open jobs and advertisement space. It’s the first (and sometimes only) impression, a handshake, and a small window into what it truly means to work at your company. From the content to the emotions visitors leave with, a careers page should tell a story- one that gives potential candidates a real sense of the culture, values, and experience of being part of the team.
At Octopus, we aren’t just hiring people to fill roles- we’re inviting them into our authentic, people-centric, and transparent culture, where we want them to do the best work of their lives. We think about the people joining our company like pieces of a much bigger puzzle, or individual threads in the organic, human fabric we’re intentionally weaving—each one adding depth, strength, and uniqueness to the whole. That feeling isn’t easy to capture with stock photos and generic careers page jargon.
When I started at Octopus in 2022, I began advocating for more talent engagement, a revamped careers page, and deeper investment in employer branding. This year, I challenged our team to consider:

- Does our careers page reflect who we truly are?
- Would we want to apply to Octopus based on what we see at first glance?
- Is it easy (and exciting!) for people to picture themselves on our team?
- Are we giving candidates a real feel for our culture, or just listing jobs?
- Does every word, image, and detail make people want to be part of this journey?
- 
With each question, it became clear—we had barely scratched the surface of what was possible. So, we set out to build something that not only showcases our opportunities but also captures the spirit of working at Octopus.


## What’s changed?

- A more human touch- You’ll see more real Octonauts sharing their experiences because culture isn’t something you describe- it’s something you show.
- Remote work, represented- As a remote-first company, we’ve made it clear how we work, collaborate, and keep things fun across multiple timezones
- A careers page with personality- No corporate jargon, no fluff. Just an authentic, engaging, and maybe even slightly quirky look at life at Octopus Deploy.
- More than just jobs- We’re shining a light on what it truly means to work at Octopus from career growth to the perks that matter with more transparency than you’ve ever seen before.

### Partnerships making this possible

This wasn’t just a talent-team project—it was a multi-threaded strategic effort that involved incredible collaboration across teams and partners.

- Our internal marketing team & Octonaut volunteers- From content creation to branding, so many Octonauts generously gave their time to shape how we tell our story. Their insights, feedback, and participation helped make this careers page a true reflection of life at Octopus. Our marketing team dove in heads first to make this a seamless experience and were invaluable in the making of our careers page.
- Adam Marsh from Moment2Moment- Our incredible on-set videographer in Australia, who captured the heart of Octopus through film. His keen eye and ability to bring our genuine, unscripted moments made all the difference in our Careers Video.
- Yoram Pollack from Visual Trigger- A true visionary behind the storytelling, video editing, and overall concept execution. Yoram took our initial ideas and allowed us to share our stories with him so that he could transform them into something beyond what we had imagined, making our dream careers page a reality.

A huge thank you to everyone who played a part- this was more than just a website update. It was about building an experience that reflects who Octonauts are and why people should be excited to join us.
