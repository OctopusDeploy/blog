If you’ve been through a website redesign, you know it’s a lot like refactoring old code. You start with confidence that it should be an easy fix, and before you know it, you’re knee-deep in overhaul and questioning how you got here. 

Our [careers page](https://octopus.com/company/careers) revamp was no different. Before the redesign, our page was fine. It was functional, informative, and technically accurate. But with the evolution of Octopus over the last few years, it wasn’t quite us anymore. So we did what many DevOps teams do when faced with legacy infrastructure—we rebuilt it.

## Why we overhauled the page

A talent team should think of their careers page as far more than just a list of open jobs and advertisement space. It’s the first (and sometimes only) impression, a handshake, and a small window into what it truly means to work at your company. From the content to the emotions visitors leave with, a careers page should tell a story. It should give potential candidates a real sense of the culture, values, and experience of being part of the team.

At Octopus, we aren’t just hiring people to fill roles. We’re inviting folks into our authentic, people-centric, and transparent culture, where we want them to do the best work of their lives. We think about the people joining our company like pieces of a much bigger puzzle, or individual threads in the organic, human fabric we’re intentionally weaving—each one adding depth, strength, and uniqueness to the whole. That feeling isn’t easy to capture with stock photos and generic content.

When I started at Octopus in 2022, I began advocating for more talent engagement, a revamped careers page, and deeper investment in employer branding. This year, I challenged our team to consider:

- Does our careers page reflect who we truly are?
- Would we want to apply to Octopus based on what we see at first glance?
- Is it easy (and exciting!) for people to picture themselves on our team?
- Are we giving candidates a real feel for our culture, or just listing jobs?
- Does every word, image, and detail make people want to be part of this journey?

With each question, it became clear that we'd barely scratched the surface of what was possible. So, we set out to build something that not only showcases our opportunities but also captures the spirit of working at Octopus.

## What’s changed?

- A more human touch - You’ll see more real Octonauts sharing their experiences because culture isn’t something you describe; it’s something you show.
- Remote work, represented - As a remote-first company, we made it clear how we work, collaborate, and keep things fun across multiple timezones.
- A careers page with personality - No corporate jargon or fluff. It's just an authentic, engaging, and maybe even slightly quirky look at life at Octopus.
- More than just jobs - We’re shining a light on what it truly means to work at Octopus, from career growth to the perks that matter, with more transparency than ever.

### The partnerships that made this possible

This wasn’t just a talent team project. It was a multi-threaded, strategic effort with collaboration across teams and partners.

- Our marketing team and Octonaut volunteers - From content creation to branding, many Octonauts generously gave their time to shape how we tell our story. Their insights, feedback, and participation helped make our careers page a true reflection of life at Octopus. Our marketing team dove in heads first to make this a seamless experience and were invaluable in the making of our careers page.
- Adam Marsh from Moment2Moment - Our incredible on-set videographer in Australia, who captured the heart of Octopus through film. His keen eye and ability to bring our genuine, unscripted moments made all the difference in our careers video.
- Yoram Pollack from Visual Trigger - A true visionary behind the storytelling, video editing, and overall concept execution. Yoram took our initial ideas and let us share our stories with him so he could transform them into something beyond what we imagined, making our dream careers page a reality.

We're grateful to everyone who played a part. We built an experience that reflects who Octonauts are and why people should be excited to join us.
