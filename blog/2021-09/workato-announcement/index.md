A [Workato connector](https://www.workato.com/integrations) that integrates with Octopus Deploy is now available. Workato is an Integration-Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) that integrates apps and automates business workflows. Its connectors contain the building blocks for recipes; including methods of authentication, triggers, and actions for a specific app. 

The Octopus Deploy connector now enables Workato users to:
Quickly integrate Octopus Deploy as part of their workflows. 
Perform operations against Octopus Deploy, such as:

- Add Build Information
- Create Release
- Deploy Release
- Get Deployment Process
- Get Spaces
- Get Projects
- Get Spaces
- Promote Release
- Push Package
- Run Runbook
- Create recipes that respond to events in Octopus through a trigger.

Additional actions may be added to the connector if/when required. 

Built in Ruby, Workato connectors are defined as a JSON configuration and registered through the Workato development environment.

According to Workato, while various teams within IT still play a significant role in [workflow automations](https://www.workato.com/the-connector/work-automation-index/), product teams and business operations teams are getting more and more involved in the process, requiring quick implementations, which can be optimised with Workatoâ€™s low-code interface.

## How to get started with Workato

You can find Octopus in the [Workato Integrations](https://www.workato.com/integrations) page, or in the Community Library>Community connectors as a logged-in user.
