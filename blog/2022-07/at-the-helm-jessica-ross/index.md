This post is the next [in our series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/At%20The%20Helm), chatting to people at Octopus about their role, what they’re working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Jessica Ross, Director of User Experience and Design.

## User Experience and Design could cover many things at Octopus - what does your team focus on?

The User Experience and Design team is embedded in teams within Marketing and R&D. They align with each team's mission and work closely with the cross-functional teams. The Product Designers work together with Product Managers and Engineers. It is the designers role to look at the problem we are solving through the user experience lens and focus on delivering validated solutions that meet the needs of the users. They spend time with users to understand their real problems for features and aim to deliver a high quality user experience.   

## How do you know if the design and user experience work is successful?

Measuring the success of our user experience and design is something that is new to us, so our goal for 2022 is to experiment to learn what metric matters to us. Each cross-functional team determines how they want to measure the success of the outcome. UX metrics form part of the overall measurement of success. For example, to increase activation the team will look at reducing the decisions users need to make and time on task. 

Designers and their teams are encouraged to not create experiences based on what they think or know. Instead they spend time researching, co-designing and testing solutions early to deliver features with a high level of confidence the solution will be successful. 

## What’s the most exciting project your team is working on this year?

There’s never one project however personally I am excited to see dedicated teams for improving the onboarding experience, improving the holistic user experience and maintaining the design system and defining the user experience for scale. 

A redesign can take a lot of effort and be disruptive yet we have had a high number of new users provide feedback that things can be hard to find and concepts difficult to understand. This year we are researching to understand the problem more and will be experimenting with incremental changes to help all users, new and existing, find what they are looking for faster and understand how Octopus works for them. 


## What’s your long-term vision for UX and design at Octopus?

We want Octopus to be an easy to use deployment tool that is able to handle the complexity our customers need. The desired outcome is for Octopus users to feel confident Octopus can guide them through setting up and maintaining complex deployment scenarios via an easy to use product to help them progress their business with the latest DevOps technologies. To do this we need exceptional designers focused on the quality of the UX and design experiences that guide users through the complexity and help users perform their task efficiently.

Internally, design is a valuable function that contributes to the success of the features and improvements shipped to our customers. We plan to continually invest in design at Octopus by:

- build a UX and Design platform that can underpin the success of a world-class UX
- include Product Designers as part of the ongoing product trios
- evolve the structure of the design function to allow for career progression
- evolve the brand and design standards 

## What advice do you have for designers wanting to join Octopus?

Octopus has a great remote culture to make sure everyone is supported and successful. To be successful as a designer at Octopus you need to be able to work well in a cross-functional team with Marketing, Product Managers and Engineers. To work well, designers need to be able to build consensus, have opinions about the user experience based on user research and testing but hold them loosely and raise the bar on the quality of UX.

Octopus or DevOps isn’t something a designer would have used or been aware of. Designers at Octopus need to be willing to be uncomfortable with ambiguity and be ok to rely on subject matter experts to understand the product and translate that into a successful experience. If you are a Product Designer who has worked to simplify and translate complexity before, Octopus Deploy may be a good fit for your next career move. 


## What’s your favorite part of being Director of User Experience and Design?

This was a new role created when we wanted to up level and grow the design function in R&D. My focus over the last 12 months has been to grow the team, mature the design function and set the team up to deliver world-class UX. The enjoyable part of the role is establishing rituals for the team and seeing the designers collaborate together and in their cross functional teams. Even though we have a decentralised team, we encourage the designers to get feedback from each other and have channels and rituals in place to help foster that. As Octopus is growing and the design function maturing it has been enjoyable working with some exceptional designers to put in place processes that work for us and challenge some existing ways of working. 

My most memorable moment with the team so far is our Q2 design week that happens every quarter. In June 2022, the design team came together and collaborated with a small group of Marketers, Product Managers and Engineers to workshop the future of the brand, UX for enterprise and reimagining the navigation and information architecture for the product.
