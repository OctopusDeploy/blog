This post is the next in our series, chatting to people at Octopus about their role, their challenges, what they're working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Bob Walker, our VP of Customer Solutions.

## How long have you been at Octopus and what drew you to work here?

I was using Octopus Deploy before I joined Octopus. I saw first-hand the benefits of implementing Octopus Deploy at 2 different companies.  

Before using Octopus at these compaies, we deployed major releases once per quarter, and it took several hours.  The deployments required emergency fixes for days after. It was easy to miss a database change or forget to update a configuration file.  

After implementing Octopus, we deployed every 10 days, and it took 15 minutes with no emergency fixes (outside of missed bugs).

Being a user and a fan, I followed Octopus on Twitter. In late 2017, I saw they were hiring in the US for the role of pre-sales engineer. The chance to work in CI/CD and help customers use a tool I was a fan of - sold! I applied that night.  

Fun fact: I filled out some forms on my first day and then boarded a plane to Brisbane, Australia. Ryan Rousseau, Principal Solutions Architect, was hired on the same day, and we were the first 2 US-based employees. None of the onboarding infrastructure we have today existed, so onboarding had to happen in Australia.    

## What does the Customer Solutions team do?

The Customer Solutions team helps customers solve complex problems. We look at Octopus as it exists right now for our customers, not what it could be in 6 months, because our customers need help today.

I use the analogy that deploying to production is like painting a room.  The painting doesn’t take long, but the prep-work and clean-up make it an event. Our customers experience the same thing. Instead of picking a color or moving the furniture, they have to make sure their deployment targets use the necessary software or know what the database delta script looks like.   

## What does a typical day look like as VP of Customer Solutions?

We have a team of intelligent and friendly people who want to help our customers to the best of their abilities. Our priority is helping customers who have reached out to us directly. We can answer some questions in a few email exchanges, but others need a longer-term engagement from weeks to months. As part of my day-to-day, I distribute the longer-term engagements, ensure they're on track, and that our customers are happy and successful.

After we devise a solution for one customer, we work out how to share that with as many customers as possible.  I also ensure the team focuses their limited time on the most important things. Can we pre-emptively answer questions with a doc update, a blog post, a webinar, or something else?  We're never short of work, so we need to identify what will have the most significant impact.  

## What are the most common questions from our customers?

Our questions vary each week and with each release.  

We recently released 2022.1, so we're currently getting lots of questions about how best to use Config as Code.  

When we get similar questions on a topic, you'll see us update our docs or add new examples on our [public samples instance](https://samples.octopus.app/app). 

We received lots of questions about upgrades a while ago, so we re-wrote the upgrade guide to include topics our customers were asking about.  Late last year, we addressed the need for rollback examples by creating a [new space in our samples instance](https://samples.octopus.app/app#/Spaces-762) and hosting a [webinar to demonstrate rolling back](https://octopus.com/events/rollback-strategies-with-octopus-deploy).

## How does your team keep up with all the changes in the world of software and our ever-evolving product?

Every month we have a week of “sharpening time.” Sharpening comes from a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, “If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend four sharpening the axe.”

During sharpening week, when we're not helping a customer, each person is sharpening their axe by delving into a topic that interests them. People on the team have found their areas of expertise this way.  For example, Shawn deep-dived into Kubernetes and set up his cluster on Raspberry Pis, while Adam deep-dived into AWS and configured the team’s VPCs, subnets, IAM, and anything else that was shared.  

The great thing about unstructured sharpening time is that you don’t know where it will lead.  

We're always adding new features and functionality to Octopus that we need to learn about, too.  When we're not sharpening, we might host a webinar, update our docs, or create a sample to cover a new feature.  If everyone in the team needs to know about a feature, we ensure they have some hands-on experience with it.

## How do you measure success internally and for our customers?

It's tricky to isolate one metric to measure success for our customers, as each person uses Octopus differently. A SaaS company that creates a unique infrastructure per customer faces different challenges than an insurance company with a suite of internal-only applications.  

Ultimately, we want our customers to be happy and successful using Octopus Deploy. One way we measure success is by looking at renewal and expansion percentages. But that's not the only metric. I’d hate for someone to renew their license “in anger”.  We evaluate a host of other indicators, such as duplicate questions, number of questions, version use, feature use, and more.
