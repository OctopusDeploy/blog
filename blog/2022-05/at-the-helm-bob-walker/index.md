This post is the next in our series, chatting to people at Octopus about their role, their challenges, what they're working on to improve the product for our customers, and more.

Here we talk to Bob Walker, our VP of Customer Solutions.

## How long have you been at Octopus and what drew you to work here?

I was a user of Octopus Deploy before I joined Octopus.  I experienced first-hand seeing the benefit of implementing Octopus Deploy at two different companies.  Before using Octopus were deploying major releases once a quarter that took several hours.  Those deployments required several emergency fixes for days after because of some missed database change or configuration file not being updated.  After implementing Octopus, eventually, we got deploying once every 10 days and it took 15 minutes with no emergency fixes (outside of missed bugs).

Being a user (and a fan) I followed Octopus on Twitter and late 2017 I saw they were hiring in the US for the first time, for the role of pre-sales engineer.  A chance to work in CI/CD and help customers use a tool I am a fan of?  Sold!  I applied that night.  Fun fact: my first day consisted of filling out some forms and then boarding a plane to Brisbane, Australia.  Ryan Rousseau were hired on the same day and are the first two US-based employees, none of the onboarding infrastructure we have in place today existed, so onboarding had to happen in Australia.  


## What does the Customer Solutions team do?

The Customer Solutions team helps customers solve complex problems as Octopus Deploy exists today.  We look at Octopus as it exists for our customers right now, not what it could be in six months, because they need help today.

The analogy I like to use is deploying to Production is like painting a room.  The actual painting part doesn’t take very long, it is all the prep-work and clean up that makes it such an event.  Our customers experience the same thing, but instead of having to pick out a color (and having the inevitable fight with their partner) or moving out all the furniture, they have to worry about making sure their deployment targets are have the necessary software or what the database delta script looks like.  

## What does a typical day look like as VP of Customer Solutions?

Everyone on the team is very smart, extremely nice, and they want to help our customers to the best of their abilities.   Our first priority is helping customers who have reached out to us directly.  Some questions can be answered in a few email exchanges, but others require a longer-term engagement lasting anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.  Part of my day to day is making sure those longer term engagements are distributed correctly, they are on track, and the customer is happy and successful.

Once we come up with a solution for one customer, the question then becomes, how can we share that with as many customers as possible?  Another part of my day to day ensuring the team is focusing their limited time on the most important thing. Can we pre-emptively answer questions with a doc update, a blog post, a webinar, or something else?  We are never bereft of ideas to work on, so it is identifying the ones with the biggest impact. 

## What are the most common questions from our customers?

It varies from week to week and release to release.  As 2022.1 just came out, we are getting more questions around best usage of Config as Code.  You can always tell when we get a set of similar questions on a topic because you’ll see a big change to our docs or new examples appear on our [public samples instance](https://samples.octopus.app/app). A while ago we were getting a lot of questions about upgrades, so we re-wrote the upgrade guide to include topics our customers were asking about.  Or, we didn’t have a good example for rollbacks, so we created a [new space in our samples instance](https://samples.octopus.app/app#/Spaces-762) as well as hosted a webinar to demonstrate how to do it. 

## How does your team keep up with all the changes in the world of software and in our ever-evolving product?

Every month we has a week of “sharpening time.”  That comes from the quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, “if I had six hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend four sharpening the axe.”

During that week, when a person is not helping a customer 1:1, they are taking the time to sharpen their axe by diving into a topic that interests them.  People on the team have found their own area of expertise.  For example, Shawn a deep dive into Kubernetes where he set up his own cluster running on Raspberry Pis, while Adam did a deep dive into AWS and configured the team’s VPCs, Subnets, IAM, and anything else that is shared.  

The unstructure sharpening time is very useful, as you don’t know where it will lead.  But we always have new features and functionality being added to Octopus that we do need to learn about.  When we are not sharpening, we work on campaigns to do things like host a webinar, update some docs, or create a sample.  Most of the time that will cover a new feature.  When we think a feature is something everyone on the team should know, then we ensure everyone on the team has some hand’s on experience.  

## How do you measure success internally and for our customers?

It can be tricky to isolate one specific metric, as each person is using Octopus a little differently.  A SaaS company who creates unique infrastructure per customer has a different set of challenges than an insurance company who has a suite of internal only applications.  Ultimately, we want our customers to be happy and successful using Octopus Deploy.  One way to measure that is by looking at renewal and expansion percentages.  But that is not the only metric.  Personally, I’d hate for a person to renew their license “in anger.”  We evaluate a host of other indicators, such as duplicate questions, number of questions, version usage, feature usage, and so on.
