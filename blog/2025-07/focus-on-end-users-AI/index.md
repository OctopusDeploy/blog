Recently I attended a conference targeted at CIOs, CTOs, and VPs of Technology.  As expected, there was a lot of sessions on AI and how they can help your company be more efficient.  The example given was the well-known use of AI in the hiring process.  "Your human resources people won't have to wade through so many CVs and interviews!"  

That use case improves the efficiency of human resources, or your people team.  But that efficiency comes at the cost of the end users, the people you are trying to hire.  Because _everyone hates_ how AI is used in hiring processes today.  Phrases like dystopian and Orwellian are common.  In this article, I'll discuss why it is important to focus on end users with real-world use cases from our AI Assistant.

## Who are your end users?

For B2C or B2B companies, the default answer is "our customers!" But that is partially correct.  It is correct for any public facing side of the business, for example a e-commerce site, a physical retail store, or a SaaS application.  What about all the internal applications and tools used within the company?  Customers never see or use those tools.  

In some cases, there are two kinds of end users.  They use the software differently based on their role.  At Octopus Deploy, our primary users are platform engineers/DevOps engineers/Team Leads.  They are the experts that developers or sysadmins turn to first when something doesn't work.  For us, our end-users are both the platform engineers and the developers.

Going back to the hiring process example, the end users are human resources AND the applicants.  For an e-commerce website, the end users are the internal marketing / product managers AND the customer.  

## Learning the wrong lessons from the success of ChatGPT

One of many benefits of ChatGPT is that it is an evolution of search engines.  Before ChatGPT, you did a Google (or DuckDuckGo) search and got back a list of results.  The search engine ranked the results for you.  They had complex algorithms to find the best results based on their internal ranking system.  A cottage industry of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) sprung up to get higher results.  ChatGPT changed that by providing you the answer curated from the pages.  It uses linear math to find the common result.  It was a huge time savings over clicking through a list of pages hoping for the best.  

All the search engines saw the writing on the wall and quickly added their own AI-based answer.  In this particular case, the end user was the customer.  They focused on providing value to their customers. 

But ChatGPT can do so much more, including generating content, images, composing songs, and more.  Experienced individuals know it is good for scaffolding, but terrible at the details.  

Unfortunately, technology companies seem insistent on learning the wrong lessons when looking at the success of other companies.  They see "people like prompts and providing answers or content to them, let's do that for [insert use case here]!"    

## Don't sacrifice your end users for the goal of efficiency
 
My first computer game was [Space Quest III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_III).  It was a standard 1980s/early 1990s Sierra game where you typed in commands to get the on-screen character to perform an action.  There is no help guide or tutorial.  You had to figure it out.  My brother and I spent _weeks_ trying to get out of the first area.  We had to find the magic set of commands to execute in a specific sequence in specific areas.

You've probably encountered the latest trend in phone support, you dial the number, and a human sounding voice asks you want you need help with.  You tell them what you need and the response is "I'm sorry, I didn't get that" or "I didn't understand."  I absolutely hate this trend.  It's like trying to get out of the first area in Space Quest III.  You need to know the magic phrase to proceed.  I can't believe I miss the days of "press 1 to...press 2 to..."  

I switched banks because my old bank had that phone support system.  I can talk to a person on the phone in less than three minutes with my new bank.  I know why my bank went with that phone system.  They believed they could help more customers with fewer support people.  They were no longer had a limit by the number of menus and submenus in the old phone system.  But they missed the point, they gained efficiency of their support team by sacrificing their customer's experience.  With ChatGPT, I'm fine with "good enough" because I can take the result and modify it as I see fit.  With banking, "good enough" is unacceptable.
