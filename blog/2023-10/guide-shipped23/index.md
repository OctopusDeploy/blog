[SHIPPED23](https://octopus.com/shipped) is our first virtual customer conference. It's coming up on Wednesday, November 15 and it's free to attend. ([You can register here](https://streamyard.com/watch/jpEyzQR8W7qr)!)

Whether you’re new to Octopus or a seasoned pro, it's a chance to upskill, learn from our DevOps experts, and discuss the challenges of modern deployments. 

Here's what's on the agenda at our inaugural event for Octopus Deploy customers worldwide. 

## Keynote - Accelerating software delivery at scale

### Paul Stovell, Founder and CEO 
9:10am CST / 3:10pm GMT

Paul Stovell founded Octopus Deploy in 2012 as a nights-and-weekends hobby project, driven by the belief that deployment time should be a time of joy and celebration that teams are motivated to do more of, rather than a scary time to avoid.

Many years and millions of deployments later, Octopus Deploy has gone deeper into the world of deployments than any other vendor, helping 3,700+ organizations to deliver valuable software faster.

In this session, Paul will revisit the Agile manifesto and retrace why deployment automation is critical to software teams. He’ll explain why it’s core to the 4 DORA metrics that predict successful software teams, and how deployments have changed over the years.

Guided by our value of listening to customers over following market trends, Paul will then discuss Octopus Deploy's outlook on the future of deployments. Learn why we've invested in cloud transformation and Kubernetes, and our vision for enterprise GitOps. Discover how Octopus is making deployments accessible to anyone. And hear how we're supporting the tooling that platform engineering teams need.

## Product - What’s new in Octopus and on our roadmap

### Colin Bowern, SVP, Product 
9:40am CST / 3:40pm GMT

Join our SVP of Product, Colin Bowern, as he recaps and demos the features we’ve shipped this year. See how they improve your experience and make your deployments more effective so you can get your software out in the wild sooner. He'll also share what's ahead on the Octopus roadmap.
