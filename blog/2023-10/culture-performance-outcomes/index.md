The recent release of the [Accelerate State of DevOps Report](https://dora.dev/research/2023/dora-report/) has once again highlighted the value of [organizational culture](https://octopus.com/devops/culture/). If you create a generative culture with high-trust and low-blame, you'll receive a 30% boost to your organization's performance.

The keys to updating the culture of a whole organization depend on the passion, support, and attention span of it's leader. At the ground level, paying attention to signals of culture can provide opportunities to make small improvements.

## The outcomes for high performance organizations

The research team describes high-performance organizations as those with:

- More customers
- Higher profits
- A larger relative share of the market

If you're part of team responsible for delivering software, there is a well established set of technical practices in the DORA Core model that will help you improve your software delivery performance.

You can add documentation to increase the impact of technical practices, and [user focus](https://octopus.com/blog/understanding-performance-team-types) will help you connect software delivery performance to the organizational outcomes.

## Cultural change for technical contributors

A common source of cultural problems is the relationship between business and technical teams. If a technical team has a problem with stability, it's common for the business to impose heavyweight process and change approvals with the intention of reducing change failure rates.

We now understand that the result of these good intentions is it makes things worse. If you want to increase software delivery performance you need to simplify change approvals and strive to deploy smaller batches of changes more often.

The technical team can start the trust-building process by improving the reliability of their deployment pipeline. Test automation will help you discover problems sooner and deployment automation will ensure you can repeatable and reliable push new versions of the software.

Improving the observability of the software will help you spot production problems. In some cases, you'll be able to find and fix issues before they become service-impacting.

These technical practices improve user satisfaction and improve the reputation of the technical team. This starts the trust building process and encourages the business team to reduce the process burden.

## Cultural change for technical managers

Technical managers can make a huge impact on team culture. You can support the technical practices required to improve deployment pipelines and present a trustworthy team to the business.

While the team improves their throughput and stability, as measured by [DORA metrics](https://octopus.com/devops/metrics/dora-metrics/), you can build relationships with the business people whose agreement you may need to remove heavyweight process.

You can also look out for some common cultural traps that some teams fall into.

Toil work should be automated to make space for more valuable tasks, but some teams instead distribute the toil work to team members. In some cases, women and under-represented groups receive a 29% higher allocation of these tasks, which increases the chances of burnout.

Documentation quality has a considerable positive benefit in converting technical practices into great business outcomes. You can increase the quality of documentation by ensuring all team members contribute changes.

You might find that team members experience a different service level for code reviews or pull requests. While some developers work is reviewed quickly, others may wait for hours or days. Increased code review speed is good for team wellbeing, but it also increases team and organizational performance.

You should monitor work distribution for signs of bias. Even distribution of work, automation of toil, and equitable treatment of code reviews will improve team culture.

## Culture has widespread benefits

Rather than wellbeing representing a cost to business, healthy cultures benefit the organization. With reduced burnout individuals are able to do better work, which increases job satisfaction and boosts the organization's performance by 30%.

Business leaders should [publish their target culture](https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/trust) and ensure they consistently reward healthy behaviors. Software teams can use technical capabilities to drive cultural change, and their leaders can monitor for signs of work distribution issues.

You can use [Westrum's typology of culture](https://octopus.com/devops/culture/workplace-topologies/) to review your progress at regular intervals.

Happy deployments!
