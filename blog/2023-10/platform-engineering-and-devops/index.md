Earlier this year, I wrote about how [Platform Engineering was part of DevOps](https://octopus.com/blog/devops-platform-engineering). More specifically, it *ought* to be part of DevOps and things often go wrong when it isn't.

## Platform Engineering without DevOps

The founding intention of DevOps was to break down the silo between the people making software. The most obvious wall to remove was the one separating development and operations, which is where the term *DevOps* came from.

If you build and run an internal developer platform without intentional collaboration with users, you're just creating a new silo.

In the decade since DevOps was created, there has been a fruitful [research effort](https://dora.dev) that has explored the complex relationships between specific practices and outcomes. The rigorous academic study of software delivery has given us a number of useful metrics and approaches that benefit people, performance, and goal attainment.

A platform that ignores the DevOps capabilities is likely to exhibit all the signs of low-performance software delivery.

- Large batches of work
- Delayed and ignored feedback
- Infrequent releases
- Low stability
- Lack of relevance to users

To achieve strong adoption rates with developers, platform teams need a high degree of user-centricity. A developer should be able to easily use the platform to solve the problems that matter to them.

## Platform Engineering within DevOps

When you apply DevOps learnings to Platform Engineering, you're more likely to measure and achieve the outcomes and benefits expected from an internal developer platform.

You'll use the [MONK metrics](https://octopus.com/devops/metrics/monk-metrics/) and [DevEx metrics](https://octopus.com/devops/metrics/devex-metrics/) to track the success of the platform and its impact on the teams who use it. You'll collaborate closely with the platform's users to understand their needs and ensure the platform solves them.

You'll be more likely to succeed now and in the future if you're deliberate in your use of DevOps and [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) to make sure you don't fall into the trap of creating a new silo.

Many of the traps are described in the [patters and anti-patterns of Platform Engineering](https://octopus.com/devops/platform-engineering/patterns-anti-patterns/).

## Moving forward with confidence

If you've decided [you need to adopt Platform Engineering](https://octopus.com/devops/platform-engineering/when-to-adopt-platform-engineering/), you should maximize your chances of success over the short and long term by wrapping everything we've learned from DevOps research around your platform's creation.

Perhaps the worst outcome from Platform Engineering would be if it took us back to the days before the development/operations boundary was removed, and before the State of DevOps research.

Happy deployments!
