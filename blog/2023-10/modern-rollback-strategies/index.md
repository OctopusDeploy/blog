It is the escape hatch everyone wants.  Harmful code made it to Production.  The website refuses to start.  Users get error messages when browsing.  It is time to roll back.  Yet, the rollback scripts weren't tested.  You last rolled back in four years ago.  The last 20 Production deployments took less than 30 minutes.  Will this rollback work?  You don't know.    

This article will go through three modern rollback strategies.  The strategies are based on recovery time.  Recovery time is how long it takes to go from "problem found" to "restored."  

## A brief primer on rollbacks

Before getting started, let's define rollbacks.  

**A rollback is reverting to a previous version of the application.  **  

There is nuance in reverting to an application's previous version.  The reversion could involve redeploying the previous version.  Or, the reversion could update a load balancer.  The strategies presented in this article will show both.

### Why Rollback

There are many reasons to roll back.  

*   The application will not start.
*   Users are unable to sign in or use the application.
*   Incorrect username, password, or token for database authentication.
*   Expired credentials.
*   Missing or incorrect configuration entries.
*   During verification, testers find a "showstopping" bug.
*   One or more external services needed to be deployed on schedule.
*   The database migration scripts failed.

That is not an exhaustive list.  I'm sure you have many more reasons why you've rolled back.  

### Rollbacks can be a symptom of a bigger problem

Many of the reasons listed above are a result of human error.  That occurs when the software delivery pipeline relies on too much manual intervention.  Manually building code, deploying build artifacts, and verifying changes is a recipe for disaster.  I cannot count how often a configuration was "fat-fingered."  

Follow the principles detailed in Dave Farley and Jez Humble's book [Continuous Delivery.  ](https://continuousdelivery.com/)Doing so will force you to automate many manual tasks.  Also, you will follow the same deployment process for all environments.  That will prevent many of the reasons to roll back.

### Rollback Risks

No rollback is risk-free.  Part of the rollback process is deciding to roll back.  Often, it is a question of which option is riskier.  Sometimes, a roll forward is less risky than a rollback.  Other times, a rollback is less risky than a roll forward.

Even if your deployment schedule is once a week, each deployment will have a mix of fixes and features.  The fixes could squash a critical bug or close a security vulnerability.  You cannot choose to roll back a specific change when rolling back.  All the changes roll back, or nothing rolls back.  

### There is no magic bullet, or one size fits all solution

I often talk to prospective customers looking for an "easy" rollback solution.  They want a tool or process that will immediately roll back their application.  A process that covers all their rollback scenarios with a minimal amount of work.  

_**Such a solution does not exist.**_  

The 15-minute strategy detailed below should take less than a day to configure.  It will cover the majority of rollback scenarios.  Having an automated deployment process removes many of the reasons rollbacks occur.  But, the process only covers some possible rollback scenarios.  

_**Implementing an immediate rollback strategy for all scenarios requires architectural and process changes.  It goes beyond the deployment tool.**_ 

I'm not referring to deployment process changes.  An immediate rollback strategy changes how you make code and database changes within your application.  It requires a robust automated suite of tests.  That all takes time and money to create.  

## Don't rollback the database

The database is a critical component of your application.  It stores all your user data.  Unless a catastrophic event happens, data loss is unacceptable.  Data loss has real-world impacts.  Imagine losing a lifesaving prescription from a patient database in a hospital.  Or a loan entry to save a family farm.    

There are two ways to rollback a databaseâ€”both of which will likely result in data loss.

1.  Run rollback scripts.
2.  Restore a database backup.

### Rollback script pitfalls

Missing or corrupted data impacts your users.   Relational databases are responsible for referential integrity.  The code base handles business rules.

Despite that, we will write rollback scripts to remove or manipulate data.  For example, you add a column to an existing table.  You need to roll back that change.  The rollback script removes that added column.  Simple.  But, that script may not take into account nuances.

*   Was there any data in that column?  If so, who added it, the users or the migration script?
*   Will users have to re-key the data once that column is re-added?
*   Is that column used as a foreign key to other tables?

### Restore database backup pitfalls

A database backup has a finite useful lifespan.  A database backup from 15 minutes ago is much more useful than one 24 hours old.    

Restoring a database backup will result in data loss.  Any data changed since that backup will be removed by the restoration.  If you are lucky, no users used the application since the database backup creation.  Luck isn't a strategy.  

### Restore databases as a last resort

Restoring database backups is an option of last resort.  It's not the default option.  Do it when a catastrophic error occurs and there is no other option.

*   Several disks on a SAN fail.
*   A hurricane hits the data center hosting the database.
*   The database file gets corrupted due to a bug.

### Take the database out of the rollback process.

The three rollback strategies below rely on a simple fact:  Never roll back a database.  Every database change is a roll forward. 

The risk of data loss or something going wrong is too high.  With enough time and effort, you can mitigate those risks.  But how often do you plan on rolling back?  It should be an exception, not the norm.  You'll end up spending a tremendous amount of time and money working on a script that will never run.  That time and effort could be better spent on improving the rollout process.

Taking the database out of the rollback process makes rollbacks more workable.  Don't get me wrong, you will still have challenges.  But they won't be "data has been lost" challenges.

## 15-Minute Recovery Rollback Strategy

The 15-minute recovery rollback strategy redeploys the previous application version.  But during the redeployment, it skips any database steps.

[Insert Screenshot Here]

### How it works

The post-deployment verification discovers a catastrophic problem.  Should you roll back?  Should you roll forward?  Before deciding, review the database migration scripts.  

*   No schema changes -> Safe to rollback.
*   Existing column added to a select stored procedure or view -> Safe to rollback.
*   New nullable columns added -> developers must review before rolling back.
*   Significant schema changes -> unsafe to rollback.

The next decision is how long it will take to fix the issue.  Is it a configuration issue?  Is it an undiscovered bug?  

Assuming it is safe to roll back, you redeploy the previous code version.  The deployment process detects it is a rollback and skips the database steps. 

### Octopus Deploy Configuration

Of the three rollback strategies, this requires the most configuration.

Step 1.  Add the Community Library Template [Calculate Deployment Mode](https://library.octopus.com/step-templates/d166457a-1421-4731-b143-dd6766fb95d5/actiontemplate-calculate-deployment-mode) to your process.  

Step 2.  Move that step to the start of the deployment process.

[Insert Screenshot Here]

Step 3.  Set the run condition to "variable" for each step to skip during rollback.  Set the value to: `#{unless Octopus.Deployment.Error}#{Octopus.Action[Calculate Deployment Mode].Output.RunOnDeploy}#{/unless}.`   I am skipping steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for my example application.

Step 4.  Test the changes.  Create a release and deploy it to a test environment.

Create another release and deploy it to the same environment.

Redeploy the first release.

In the deployment, you'll see all the database steps skipped.

### Recovery time explained

The redeployment will take at most 5-10 minutes unless you have a complex process.  That is because database steps can be time-consuming.  Skipping them will speed up the redeployment.  It is common to see a redeployment take 1/3 to 1/2 of the time.

The majority of the recovery time is spent reviewing database migration scripts.  Is it safe to roll back?  Would a rollback introduce too much risk and unknowns?  

### Who the strategy is for

Anyone not doing rollbacks today should consider this strategy first.

*   You only need to change the deployment process, not how you make database changes.
*   With minimal effort, you have covered most use cases.

After I implemented automated deployments, the vast majority of rollback requests came from QA.  Development and test environments are unstable during normal software development.  An unexpected bug can slip through despite pull requests, code reviews, and automated tests.  

There are far more code changes than database changes.  Especially in development and testing environments.  It is common to see 20 code check-ins for every database check-in.  There is a high likelihood a showstopping bug can be rolled back.  

### Downsides and pitfalls

The primary downside of this strategy is you can only roll back in some situations.  A breaking schema change prevents rollbacks.  The only course of recovery is to roll forward.  That could take hours or days.  

### Deployment automation removes a lot of reasons to rollback

Don't dismiss this strategy because of the potential for multi-hour recovery.  That is looking at this strategy through the lens of manual deployments.  Look at it through the lens of automated deployments.  Many scenarios requiring a rollback no longer apply with automated deployments.

*   Source control houses all the application configurations.  The deployment tool automatically applies those configurations.
*   Code is automatically built following the same process.  No steps are accidentally skipped.
*   The same build artifact is deployed to all environments.  What passed testing, automated or manual, goes to Production.
*   The build artifacts are automatically deployed using the same process for all environments.  The process is tested at least once before Production.
*   Most automated deployments take 10-15 minutes to complete.  Pushing a fix through all the required environments can take less than an hour.  
*   Most failures requiring a rollback will now occur in testing environments, not Production. 

This strategy requires minimum effort but has a significant pay-off.

## 5-Minute Recovery Strategy

Decouple the database changes from the code changes.  Deploy the database changes hours or days before code changes.  The previous application version will work with the current database changes.  That removes a significant risk when rolling back.

[Insert Screenshot Here]

### How it works

Decouple the deployment processes for the code and database.  

1.  Hours or days before deploying the application, deploy the database changes.
2.  After a period of time, deploy the code changes.
3.  Roll back the code changes upon discovery of a showstopping bug.

There is no need to check database migration scripts before rolling back.  You already know the previous application version works with the current database.  

Automated testing is a must for this strategy.  The only way you know database changes are backward compatible is via testing.  The only way to test everything is via automation.  Without an automated testing suite, you will miss something.  

### Expand and Contract Pattern

This strategy requires the adoption of the expand and contract pattern.

[Insert Diagram Here]

Unlike the previous rollback strategy, the expand and contract pattern requires four deployments.  Using the example from the diagram, change the colorName column name to colorCode.

1.  The first deployment adds the new column "colorCode" to the database.  That is the expansion.
2.  The second deployment updates the source code to write to both columns.  Also, backfill "colorCode" if possible.
3.  The third deployment removes the code that writes to "colorName."
4.  The fourth deployment removes the "colorName" column from the database.

It is an iterative approach to making database changes.  Each deployment makes small changes that can be rolled back.  But you cannot roll back once the fourth deployment occurs.

### Octopus Deploy Configuration

Of the three strategies, this strategy requires the least amount of configuration.  Move the database deployment process into a separate project.

Remove any database steps from the application project.

If you need to share variables between projects, leverage the Octopus Deploy [Library Variable Sets](https://octopus.com/docs/projects/variables/library-variable-sets).

### Recovery time explained

Like the 15-minute strategy, this strategy involves a redeployment.  Unlike that strategy, this strategy does not need a migration script review.  Because of that, this strategy makes it quicker to recover.

### Who the strategy is for

This is the strategy for anyone looking to improve their automated deployment process.  This strategy will speed up both recovery and deployment time.  

*   Only deploy the application code during the deployment window.
*   All the database work occurs hours or days before the application deployment.
*   The database changes are small incremental changes that are backward compatible.

### Downsides and pitfalls

Decoupling database and code changes is a challenging task.  There is more work outside of implementing the expand and contract pattern.  That work includes moving the database schema to a separate git repository and creating a new delivery pipeline.  

There will be a lot more deployments with this strategy.  Everyone has to be "on board" with the expansion and contract pattern.  That includes developers, database developers, QA, DBAs, Web Admins, and support staff.  One person not on board can de-rail the whole process.  

Building out the testing suite to test database changes will take time.  The application may not support automated testing.  If it does not, it will need extra work to rearchitect the application to support automated testing.  That alone is a monumental effort.  

All that extra work can be seen as overkill, depending on the application. 

## Immediate Rollback Strategy

This strategy builds on the 5-minute rollback strategy.  It adds blue/green or a staging deployment pattern.  In other words, run two versions of your application in Production.  Use a load balancer or ingress controller to control traffic.  Deploy the code to Production the load balancer is not pointing to.  Then, test it before releasing it to users.

[Insert Screenshot]

### How it works

This strategy is like the 15-minute rollback strategy.  It has a couple of extra steps.

*   Deploy the database changes hours or days before the code changes.
*   Deploy the latest version of the application to a "staging" or "blue/green" set of servers in Production.  All users will continue to use the older version of the application.
*   Verify the latest version of the application.  The verification process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 4 hours.
*   Assuming verification passes, update the load balancer to redirect all traffic to the new version.
*   Don't update the load balancer if verification fails.
*   Update the load balancer back to the previous version in the event of a showstopping bug.

### Modeling In Octopus Deploy

Like the 5-minute recovery strategy, the database and application are in different projects.  The critical difference is the application deployment process will deploy to a blue or green environment.

Step 1.  Create two new environments, Production-Blue and Production-Green.

[Insert Screenshot]

Step 2.  Create a new lifecycle called "Blue/Green Deployments." Create a phase called "Production" and add both environments to it.

[Insert Screenshot]

Step 3.  In the application's project, update the channel to use the new lifecycle.

[Insert Screenshot]

Step 4.  In the project variables, review the variable values scoped to Production.  Add scoping for Production-Blue and Production-Green.  Repeat for any library variable sets.

Step 5.  Update all the existing production targets for your application to Production-Blue OR Production-Green.

Step 6.  Create a runbook to update the load balancer.

Step 7.  Add the appropriate steps to update your load balancer.  This runbook will tell the load balancer to direct traffic to Production-Blue or Production-Green.

Step 8. **Optional!!!** Add the [Run Octopus Deploy Runbook](https://library.octopus.com/step-templates/0444b0b3-088e-4689-b755-112d1360ffe3/actiontemplate-run-octopus-deploy-runbook) step to your deployment process to invoke that runbook.  This step is optional; you may invoke that runbook manually.

**Please note:** The database will not be deployed to Production-Blue or Production-Green.  There is one copy of the database.  That database lives in the Production environment.  Your dashboard will look like the screenshot below.

### Recovery time explained

Unlike the previous strategies, there are no redeployments.  Two versions of the application run in Production.  A rollback involves updating a load balancer or a configuration.  With automation, it takes seconds to go from "problem found" to "recovered."  

### Who the strategy is for

This strategy is for anyone who has implemented the expand and contract pattern and wants to take the next step.  This strategy has several benefits.

*   Like the 5-minute strategy, deploy database changes hours or days before the application.
*   Deployments can occur in the middle of the day.
*   Take as much time as required to verify the latest application version.  No users are using it.  
*   Updating the load balancer can occur during off hours via a scheduled task or runbook.

### Downsides and pitfalls

All the work required by the 5-minute strategy is required for this strategy.  Also, you must figure out how to run two application versions in Production.  That is a challenging task.

*   Create or configure additional application hosts.
*   Verify how data from the old version interacts with data from the new version.  Write more automated tests when fixing issues.
*   Verify how the application behaves after updating the load balancer.  Expect cross-talk between the old UI version and the new API version.  Especially with modern SPA JavaScript applications.

Of all the rollback strategies, this requires the most time and money.  Depending on the application, it can be overkill.  For example, an internal application used by a dozen people doesn't need a blue/green strategy.  

### Feature Flags

Don't be surprised if you leverage feature flags and tools like LaunchDarkly.  Releasing a new feature to _everyone_ has its own pitfalls.  It is common to see Blue/Green and feature flags used in conjunction.  

*   Update the load balancer for users to use the new application version.  
*   But prevent users from using a new feature.  
*   Release the new feature to a subset of users using a feature flag and gather feedback.
*   Continue to release the feature to more users.
*   Stop releasing the feature when encountering an issue. 

## The perfect roll-forward strategy

Ironically, the immediate rollback strategy is the perfect roll-forward scenario.  

*   You deploy to Production on an isolated set of application hosts.
*   You verify that new version while users continue to use the old application version.  
*   Keep the users on the old application version if any issues are found.  
*   Take the necessary time to fix the issues.
*   Deploy the fixes to those same set of application hosts from before.  
*   Verify the fixes.
*   Assuming verification is successful, redirect the traffic to the new application version.

Adding feature flags makes rolling forward more workable.  With feature flags, you can restrict how many users can access a new feature.  Enable the feature flag for a subset of users.  If any issues are found, don't enable the feature flag for other users.  Fix the issue, verify it, and then enable the feature flag for other users.

The point is the immediate rollback strategy created several "gates."  Those gates prevent "bad code" from reaching your entire user base.  Fixing an issue impacting a limited number of users is much easier and less stressful.  

## Conclusion

Creating a zero-downtime, immediate rollback process is one of the most challenging tasks in DevOps.  It involves many changes.  And not just in the software delivery pipeline.  Many internal processes and development practices need to change.  

Unless you are prepared to make all those changes, I'd push that scenario down the to-do list.  Solve the more significant problems first.  A rollback happens when an unexpected issue occurs.  Typically, humans and manual processes are the cause of those issues.  

The first step to creating a rollback process is to automate the software delivery pipeline.  The software delivery pipeline should deploy all the components, including code and databases.  That will resolve many of those causing rollbacks in the first place.  After doing that, then start with the 15-minute recovery strategy.  You will cover most of the possible rollback scenarios by doing that.

After that, implement the expand and contract pattern.  Making small, incremental, backward-compatible changes to the database is always a win.  That will prepare you for the 5-minute and immediate rollback strategies.  

Implement the 5-minute and immediate rollback strategies strategically.  They are not needed for every application.  Discuss it with your team, business owner, and product owner, and get a consensus.  

Until next time, happy deployments (and rollbacks)!
