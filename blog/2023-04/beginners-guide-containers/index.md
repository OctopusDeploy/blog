Containers are a popular way to deliver applications. They're well suited to those working in many environments or building software in microservices.

But what are they exactly? How do they work? Why should you use them? And how do they differ from related services?

Worry not! This blog explains everything beginners need to know about containers.

## Containers in a nutshell

Containers are lightweight virtual environments. They package everything needed to run an application or microservice, including:

- Code
- Configuration files
- Libraries
- Dependencies

With everything needed in one deployable format, containers are very versatile. You can host, deploy, and move your applications almost anywhere.

Containers are also very easy to spin up and tear down, so they're an excellent option for applications that need to scale with demand.

## How containers differ to virtual machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are digital computers that run on servers or other computers. VMs allow you to install and use common operating systems like Microsoft Windows or Linux. Tech teams commonly used VMs to reduce space taken by physical servers.

Containers, however, are standalone virtual environments without the bloat of an operating system.

These are the key difference between the 2 technologies:

- Isolation - Containers isolate at the operating system level. VMs isolate at the hardware level.
- Management - You can't change containers after deployment, only destroy and replace them. VMs allow for the same changes as physical computers.
- Resources - Containers need fewer resources as they don't emulate operating systems. VMs need extra resources to power their operating systems.
- Portability - You can move containers between hosting environments without major changes to the infrastructure. To move VMs, you must reconfigure your virtual and physical infrastructure.

Both containers and VMs have different strengths and weaknesses. Your choice depends on the needs of your application and the type of environment you're deploying to. 

Containers, however, offer the following benefits:

- Deploy and move your applications anywhere
- Scale your application as demand increases or decreases
- Use fewer resources to run your applications
- Ensure your application and infrastructure are the same across all instances, no matter where you host
- Recover faster due to the speed and ease of spinning 

We went into more depth on [the benefits of containers in a previous blog](https://octopus.com/blog/benefits-of-containerization).

## Where Docker and Kubernetes fit alongside containers

If working in software development, youâ€™ve likely heard of 'Docker' and 'Kubernetes'. Neither is essential for small projects, but together they solve most problems you'd likely find with containers.

Let's explore how they help with containers.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a service that helps you package, test, and manage software using Docker's [OCI image format](https://opencontainers.org/). Docker made the OCI format open source, and it's now the industry standard on nearly all container services.

One of Docker's most popular fservices is its container registry, [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Docker Hub lets you store and organize all your container images so they're easy to find and deploy.

### Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestration tool that helps you manage and automate the scaling of your software.

When you deploy to Kubernetes, it creates a cluster of containers with your software on your hosting service. Kubernetes can then manage the traffic between your containers based on available resources.

Kubernetes can also create new clusters as container resources hit their limits and destroy them if unused. Kubernetes can also detect broken containers and replace them with new ones.

Both benefits help ensure high availability and consistency no matter which node your customers connect to.
