Each year, we look forward to the release of the Accelerate State of DevOps Report at Octopus Deploy. The report, from Google Cloud and DORA, is academically rigorous and is the [longest-running research effort of its kind](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html), providing crucial insights into the practices and capabilities you need to achieve high performance in software delivery.

From the report, we've learned what combination of technical and cultural techniques drives performance in software delivery and at the organization level. The capabilities and relationships have been analyzed from more than 33,000 survey responses.

We're even more excited than usual this year, as Octopus has sponsored the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report, published on September 28th.

## Background

The Accelerate State of DevOps Report has been running for 8 years, tracking specific practices that predict high performance in software delivery. The report establishes links between techniques and outcomes called *predictive indicators*, which means when a team uses the practice, they and their organization are more likely to perform well.

The DevOps capabilities work best together, amplifying the positive effects and increasing the cultural and organizational benefits.

In 2021, the key insights included:

- How culture mitigated burnout
- Where cloud adoption was a driver for performance
- How software supply chain security impacts performance
- How documentation improved security, reliability, and cloud use

The [DORA metrics](https://octopus.com/blog/dora-metrics-devops-business-outcomes) are one of the practical tools to emerge from the report. A 5th metric was added in 2021 for _reliability_.

[Octopus Deploy 2022.3+](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2022-q3#devops-insights-better-visibility-and-actionable-dora-metrics-early-access-preview) includes DevOps Insights for better visibility into your company’s DevOps performance, by surfacing data based on the first 4 DORA metrics. Our [DevOps Insights](https://octopus.com/docs/insights) reporting helps you qualify the results of your DevOps performance, and see where you can improve.

## New insights in 2022

As always, the latest Accelerate State of DevOps Report contains new insights, and you'll find several changes in [this year's report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/).

One of the headlines is that the biggest predictor for security practices is cultural, not technical. You're more likely to adopt appropriate security practices if your team has a high-trust/low-blame culture. These practices increase software delivery and operational performance and reduce burnout.

> It's more obvious than ever that organizational culture 
> and modern development processes are the best place to start for 
> organizations looking to improve their security posture.

There are also insights for:

- The role of _reliability_ in performance
- Rates of adoption of cloud technologies
- A new categorization of respondents into clusters
