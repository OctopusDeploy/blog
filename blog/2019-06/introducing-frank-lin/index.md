G’day g’day! It’s been just over a week since I joined Octopus as a Senior Software Engineer here in beautiful, sunny Brisbane.

I always tell people that programming is a creative art, like painting - there are a million ways to solve the problem, or mess it up. Doing this in a team is even more fun as we repeatedly paint over each other’s work. I enjoy finding ways to improve the way the team works, and putting things in place that naturally reduces mistakes and guides you on the right path.

I heard many good things about Octopus before joining, and the rumours were right! Everyone I’ve met so far have made me feel right at home and the company has a culture of  openness and transparency. I’m excited to continue my learning here and hope that my contributions will help the company to grow and thrive.
