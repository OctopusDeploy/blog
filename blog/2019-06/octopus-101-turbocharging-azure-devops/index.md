We've started hosting regular Webinars, and up next in our Continuous Integration series, [Derek](https://twitter.com/OctoDerek), and [Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanrousseau) are going to discuss [Turbo Charging Azure DevOps with Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_93jsiLalSPCLfApxzfWNGA).

We often still see, organizations and members of the Dev and Ops teams have automated the build & test, but still, need to deploy manually and out of hours. In this session, Derek and Ryan will take you through how to integrate Azure DevOps and Octopus Deploy using the [Azure DevOps & TFS extension](https://octopus.com/downloads). They will then configure an Azure pipeline, and lastly, pass the package through to Octopus Deploy which will then deploy to Azure from a single build and test from Development all the way to Production.

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/) and Octopus Deploy go together like peanut butter and jelly and are easily integrated and used to deploy to [Azure IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-iaas/), [Azure PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-paas/), [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and on-premise.

This session will run on July 17th, 2019, 4.30pm UTC/10.30am ET, and you can register [here](https://octopus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_93jsiLalSPCLfApxzfWNGA).

Additionally, we have been running [Octopus 101: Getting Started Webinars](https://octopus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5ZaCOiP5SXSUhSztPPuSgQ), and the next one is on June 26th, where Derek and Ryan will cover the core concepts of Octopus.

Moreover, if you haven't seen them yet, check out our [Ask Octopus series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGskdGvlaw3-cd9rPiwhwfUo7kDGnOBh).
