The end of 2022 is fast approaching. As most of the Octopus team prepares for a break (don’t worry, we’re still available to help if you need), we thought it a great time to take a breath and reflect.

So, *'come in, come in, and know us better'* as we take a trip with the ghosts of deployments past, present, and yet to come. 

We guarantee they’re a lot nicer than those who visited Scrooge.

## Deployments past

Before we look at Octopus in 2022, let's take a moment to see where we left off in 2021.

2021 was a huge year for Octopus, with many milestones. We:

- Grew our team from 77 to 179 people
- Announced an [investment from Insight Partners](https://octopus.com/blog/insight-investment)
- Saw our revenue grow by 60%
- Passed our first audit
- Launched new features in early access preview, like Config as Code and Amazon ECS support
- Opened our new office in South Bank, Brisbane. Just look at it!

## Deployments present

2022 has also been a phenomenal year for Octopus. Let’s explore some of our most noteworthy highlights.

### How we improved Octopus

In 2022, we launched a heap of new features to save you time and effort with your deployments. Plus, we created more integrations for the services you use.

- [Config as Code for deployments](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2022-q1) left early access.
- [DevOps Insights](https://octopus.com/docs/insights) (early access preview) - Octopus uses DORA metrics to show you how your organization is performing.
- [Automatic cloud target discovery](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/cloud-target-discovery) - Connect your credentials, and Octopus can find your deployment targets on Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Services (GCS) via tags.
- [Improvements to Octopus's deployment steps](https://octopus.com/blog/improving-delivery-deployment-steps) - We made a new framework for deployment steps, making them easier to understand, write, and manage.
- New integrations, including:
   - [GitHub Actions deployments](https://octopus.com/github) - Install the Octopus CLI, push packages, trigger runbooks, and more.
   - [Buildkite](https://octopus.com/blog/introducing-buildkite-integration) - Use the Octopus CLI to create releases, push build information, and trigger runbooks through Buildkite.
   - [Jira Service Management](https://octopus.com/blog/jira-service-management-eap) and [ServiceNow](https://octopus.com/blog/servicenow-integration-eap) (both early access preview) - Simplify and automate your ITSM approval and change management processes.
   - [Amazon ECS support](https://octopus.com/docs/deployments/aws) - Easily deploy ECS services through Octopus's UI. We also improved our AWS CloudFormation step template.

### Free tools to help you

We developed easy-to-use tools that help you build deployment pipelines.

- [GitHub Actions workflow generator](https://octopus.com/freetools/github-actions-workflow-generator) - Create customizable workflows for your GitHub Actions deployments.
- [Jenkins pipeline generator](https://octopus.com/freetools/jenkins-pipeline-generator) - Quickly build a customizable Jenkins pipeline.
- [Octopus Workflow Builder](https://octopusworkflowbuilder.octopus.com/) - From GitHub to AWS and everything in between, create a working deployment pipeline in minutes.

### Our homepage has a new look

Though we're still making tweaks and there's more to come, [Octopus.com](https://octopus.com) has a fresh new look!

Not only does it look great (if we say so ourselves), it better explains the problems Octopus Deploy solves and how it helps you deliver software faster.

### We announced our first acquisition

Announced in February, [we acquired Dist](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-acquires-dist) - a cloud container and artifact repository service.

The acquisition helps us make Octopus's cloud functionality and support even better.

### Octopus is more secure than ever thanks to our ISO27001 certification

Octopus has always taken security seriously, but we understand our customers can't just take our word for it. Our Trust team's goal for 2022 was to get ISO27001 certification, the best-known standard in managing information security.

To do this, our team:

- Set many new security audit and review functions
- Refreshed our security policies and training
- Made sure our documentation matched our actions at every step of the development lifecycle

The hard work paid off in late 2022, as we successfully passed our audits and received our official ISO27001 certification. We hope this certification gives you peace of mind.

The certificate will be on our website to download soon, but our journey doesn't end there. We aim to add to our security qualifications in 2023, so keep your eyes peeled for new developments.

### We launched the DevOps engineer's handbook
  
DevOps can be confusing, so we created the [DevOps engineer's handbook](https://octopus.com/devops/) to help others learn about its processes and philosophies.

At launch, we're focusing heavily on our specialist subject - Continuous Delivery - but the handbook will expand and evolve.

Plus, if you're looking for DevOps book recommendations, we got you covered with our [interactive reading list](https://octopus.com/devops/reading-list/).
<!---
### We had a record quarter (may need to cut)

We ended 2022 on a new high! Quarter 4 was a record quarter for business completed.

We look forward to building on this and helping more organizations deliver software faster and more reliably.

### 2022 in stats (Unfinished)

Let's end the 2022 milestones with some fun stats about Octopus's year:

- **number of deployments by customers this year**
- **number of new trials**
- 673,058 pageviews on our blog - [How to install Jenkins on Docker](https://octopus.com/blog/jenkins-docker-install-guide) was our most popular post, with 33,392 views
- **number of lines of code (Waiting for Ben Pearce)**
- Our team grew by 61, putting us at 240 Octonauts

## Deployments yet to come

Of course, we're always working to improve Octopus, so what's in our future? For the moment, we're working on:

- Dynamic environment support - Easily provision infrastructure for testing new feature branches, integrations, and more.
- Config as Code for Octopus Runbooks - See and manage your runbook processes in your Git repository, just like you already can with your deployment processes.
- Octopus CLI vNext - We're adding new functions, like an easy-to-use interactive mode and more.

[Keep an eye on our roadmap](https://octopus.com/company/roadmap) for more information on these features and to discover what else might be on the horizon.

Happy deployments, everyone!
