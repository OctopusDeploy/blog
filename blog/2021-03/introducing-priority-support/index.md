![Introducing priority support](blogimage-introducing-priority-support.png)

At Octopus Deploy, how we support our customers has always been important to us. We don't just want to build the world's great deployment tool; we want to make sure you have a great experience using Octopus Deploy, and that when you need help, we're here to provide it.

In the early days, the entire team, from our CEO down, answered support emails. As we grew, we added a dedicated team of support engineers who worked closely with our product engineering teams to ensure we were giving our customers the best possible support. Now we have support engineers based in Australia, the UK, and the US, which means we provide support 24 hours a day five days a week and there's no time zone lag.

You can access support by [email](mailto:support@octopus.com) and on our [support forum](https://help.octopus.com/), or if you prefer to self-support, we have [documentation](https://www.octopus.com/docs), a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/octopusdeploy), and a [community Slack channel](http://octopus.com/slack).

## Priority Support 

Priority Support is an additional option we're introducing for customers who need guaranteed response times and availability for support tickets. 

Priority support is available 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Customers with Priority Support can expect: 

- A response within 1 hour to their first email.
- An average response time of 1 hour for all other emails until the support issue has been resolved. 

These response times apply to anybody who emails our support team from your email domain. For instance, if we receive a support request from a user with an email address @example.com and example.com has Priority Support, the request will be flagged as a priority issue and they will receive a response within 1 hour.

### Availability 

Priority Support is available to all new and existing Octopus Deploy customers with a valid paid license.

The cost of Priority Support is $800 USD per month and is billed annually.

If we fail to meet our guarantees as outlined above for a given month, we will credit that **full month** of support fees back to you. This credit will then be available to be used on subsequent priority support or license key renewals. If you decide to stop using Octopus Deploy and still have available credit, we will refund the balance of the credit.

Priority Support can be added to your account the next time you renew your license. If this is coming up soon for you, and youâ€™re interested in Priority Support, please email our sales team at [sales@octopus.com](mailto:sales@octopus.com).

### Early access

This program is an early-access offering, and we are still in the process of finalizing the management tooling and the legal modification to our Customer Agreement. 

By May 1st, 2021, we will have launched a management dashboard, where you can see a summary of the tickets we've received from your Priority Support domain and our response rates.

If, after we've released the management dashboard and the legal agreement, you no longer want to continue your Priority Support agreement, we'll refund the remaining unused portion of the year to you in full.

## Conclusion

Support is a critical component of Octopus Deploy, and we hope that by adding the option of Priority Support, we can provide the guarantees that some of our customers need.

Happy Deployments!
