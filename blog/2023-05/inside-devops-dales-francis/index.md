This post is the next in our [Inside DevOps series](https://octopus.com/blog/tag/Inside%20DevOps), where we share lessons learned from those on the frontlines of DevOps.
  
Hear from [Dale Francis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-francis-9147b2111/), Director, Product Development at [Climavision](https://climavision.com/).

Climavision is a climate technology weather solutions provider based in the US.

**What is DevOps to you? How do you define it?**

*Dale*: 

**How did your DevOps journey start?**

*Dale*: 

**What’s the biggest challenge Octopus has helped you with?**

*Dale*: 

**What’s the most rewarding part of DevOps?**

*Dale*: 

**Are there any pitfalls to avoid when implementing DevOps?**

*Dale*: The automation, by far! Seeing something you worked very hard on pay off by enabling quick and reliable deployments for years to come is priceless! It’s like you’re breathing life into a process that never existed before, and it’s now functioning completely autonomously. Hence it has a life of its own. That’s super rewarding to experience in this role.

**What are some DevOps best practices you’ve implemented at Climavision?**

*Dale*: 

**What is the advice you would give to those who are just starting their DevOps journey?**

*Dale*: 


**What DevOps book would you recommend reading?**

*Dale*: It’s been a while since I read it, but I loved [The Phoenix Project](https://octopus.com/devops/reading-list/#the-phoenix-project-book). I still recall a lot of what they talked about in that book day-to-day on the job. 

**And what is one thing about you that might surprise us?**

*Dale*: 

**That sounds just right - applying patterns and building things fits the developer persona perfectly!**
