## Background - When and why does Octopus use Mono?
Way back in 2015, the release of Octopus 3.0 introduced support for [deploying releases on Linux via SSH Targets](https://octopus.com/blog/deployment-targets-in-octopus-3#multiple-types-of-machines-deployment-targets). The Octopus Deploy deployment execution engine framework, Calamari, was at the time built only on .net full framework. .NetCore had only recently been announced and 1.0 was yet to be released over a year later so the only way to run the deployment process was invoking it via [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/). Mono has served it's purpose well, however with .netcore f..........

### Technical Notes - What is Mono?
Mono provides a CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) virtual machine which can be run on various non windows platforms. which includes various components such as a JIT compiler that takes .net code compiled into CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
The Mono CLI also includes a .NET Framework Class Library which although compatible with Microsoftâ€™s .NET Framework classes, are seperate to the standard .Net Framework libraries used on a standard Windows machine using .Net Full Framwork. This mean that these libraries are tied to specific versions of the Full Framework and are not intended to serve as a replacement for libraries found in .Net Core. One side effect of this is that code being compiled for Full Framework, Mono and .Net Core are filled with various compiler directives switching out various import statments or even entire classes. 

### The rise of .Net Core and reducing dependency on Mono
For some users the Mono dependency was problematic, so in [early 2017 we introduced support for what we call Raw Octopus](https://octopus.com/blog/trying-raw-octopus). This mechanism allows for running scripts directly through the SSH shell without any of the helpful orchestration provided by Calamari, but also as a result without any of the dependencies required to runn Calamari. Due to it's simplicity this mechanism has always remained a niche fallback mechanism available for constrained platforms.

The supported API surface area provided by the release of .netcore 2.0 in mid 2017 allowed us to quickly work towards [Mono-less SSH targets in 3.16](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-3-16#ssh-targets-sans-mono). This was the first releas that allowed for running Octopus deployments on a Linux system with .netcore and was fairly quickly taken up by customers as a simpler mechanism for running their deployment workloads on Linux servers.
