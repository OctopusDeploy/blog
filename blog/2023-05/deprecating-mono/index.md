This post will walk through the history of Mono at Octopus, along with the steps that we have taken towards removing it as a dependancy for Linux deployments.
If your Octopus Server instance is configured to deploy to SSH targets via Mono (and not self-contained .Net Core)

A [GitHub issue has been created](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/8146) where you can provide feedback or questions to reduce the potential impact.

## Background - When and why does Octopus use Mono?
Way back in 2015, the release of Octopus 3.0 introduced support for [deploying releases on Linux via SSH Targets](https://octopus.com/blog/deployment-targets-in-octopus-3#multiple-types-of-machines-deployment-targets). The Octopus Deploy deployment execution engine framework, [Calamari](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Calamari), was at the time built only on .net full framework. .NetCore had only recently been announced and 1.0 was yet to be released over a year later so the only way to run the deployment process was invoking it via [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/). Mono has served it's purpose well, however with .netcore f..........

### Technical Notes - What is Mono?
Mono provides a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure) (Common Language Infrastructure) virtual machine which can be run on various non windows platforms. The CLI comprises of the runtime required to invoke .Net code  previously into CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
including components such as the JIT compiler, garbage collector and library loader. These components would typically be provided by the installed .Net Framework installed on a Windows machine. It is an amazing set of tools that was developed by the whole Mono team that opened up .Net development for (and on) non Windows machines before it was fully supported by Microsoft itself.
 
The Mono CLI also includes a .NET Framework Class Library which, although compatible with Microsoftâ€™s .NET Framework classes, are seperate to the standard .Net Framework libraries used on a typical Windows machine using .Net Full Framwork. This mean that these libraries are tied to specific versions of the Full Framework and are not intended to serve as a replacement for libraries found in .Net Core. One side effect of this is that code being compiled for Full Framework, Mono and .Net Core are filled with various compiler directives switching out various import statments or even entire classes. 

### The rise of .Net Core and reducing dependency on Mono
For some users the Mono dependency was problematic, so in [early 2017 we introduced support for what we call Raw Octopus](https://octopus.com/blog/trying-raw-octopus). This mechanism allows for running scripts directly through the SSH shell without any of the helpful orchestration provided by Calamari, but also as a result without any of the dependencies required to runn Calamari. Due to it's simplicity this mechanism has always remained a niche fallback mechanism available for constrained platforms.

The supported API surface area provided by the release of .netcore 2.0 in mid 2017 allowed us to quickly work towards [Mono-less SSH targets in 3.16](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-3-16#ssh-targets-sans-mono). This was the first releas that allowed for running Octopus deployments on a Linux system with .netcore and was fairly quickly taken up by customers as a simpler mechanism for running their deployment workloads on Linux servers.

## Why are we deprecating mono?
Developing an application that runs on multiple platforms and runtimes has a non-zero cost that we must account for with its usage.

* **Support Costs** - Customers sometimes have questions or issues with setting up a Mono based SSH Target. Although the general reccomendation is now to just try the self-contaned .NetCore option, this still creates a support overhead.
* **Development Costs** - Since the surface area of .NetCore does not perfectly overlap with the Core Libraries provided by Mono (or .Net Full Framework), there are parts of the code which include preprocessor directives that create a codebase that is harder to reason with. This adds impacts the ease of maintaining the code and increases the solution complexities requiring multiple projects or dependencies depending on the platform being compiled for.
* **Testing Costs** - In addition to multiple Windows and Linux (with .NetCore) build configurations, we run almost the entire suite of Calamari tests against about 20 additional agent configurations to cover the various Linux platforms and Mono versions that might be encountered. This adds additional overhead in terms of time (which translates directly into dollars to run and maintain these systems) and developer effort. Every time a test fails, which can happen when integrating with external systems or running on complex build infrastructure, it may take hours out of a developers time to stop, context switch and investigate.

With the modern alternatives available for deploying to Linux that the majority of our customers now rely on, Mono no longer justifies the maintenance cost levied on both the development and verification of our software.

## Impacts
For the majority of our current SSH Mono users the changes required will be fairly minor. There are however some potential impacts for some platforms and functionality once the only option is the .netcore compiled binaries or raw scripting.

### ScriptCS
At the time of writing, ScriptCS is not currently supported on the .netcore version of Calamari however some scheduled updates will soon change this. Check out the [related blog post](https://octopus.com/blog/rfc-migrate-scriptcs-dotnet-script) for further details on the plans and [possible workarounds](https://octopus.com/blog/rfc-migrate-scriptcs-dotnet-script#workaround) if this affects you.

### RHEL6
Running deployments on RHEL6 and below requires compiling for the `rhel-x64` runtime which we currently do not do. Cross-compiling to cater for these targets would negatively impact the bundled Octopus Server installation size for all customers which cannot be justified given the platform's reported usage. Since we explicitly call out support only for RHEL7.2 and above we will not be providing a solution for earlier versions of RHEL. Users on RHEL6 are encouraged to upgrade to the later versions of this platform to continue running deployment steps.

### FreeBSD
FreeBSD does [not currently support .netcore](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/14537) at all, however this may change in the future. Based on target statistics it does not look like there are any instances that run on FreeBSD today so we dont expect this to impact any of our users. When Mono is deprecated we will likely fully drop support for FreeBSD untill it is possible to run .netcore.
