Incoming UI goodness!

We have listened to our customer feedback about the experience of Octopus Deploy. Our particular team is focusing on the Navigation experience. Let's take a look at our first step in improving our navigation. See the below for a before and after.

### Before

### After!

- **Spaces:** Square instead of round. We will be moving away from the use of circles from spaces and projects. This helps with easier visual identification of elements across the app.
- **Stronger Visual Hierarchy:*** You can easily identify which section of app you are located in
- **Configuration / Administration:*** Moved to a cog icon on the far right following standard navigation patterns



A little bit of background…

## Navigation

We understand that the navigation isn’t the easiest in Octopus Deploy based on user feedback and we have taken our time to understand why and its complexities. Navigation is more than just the menu. It's how the users go from page to page, where features/functions live and in a way that is harmonious with the mental models used in managing deploys and so it isn’t as simple of reorganizing where items live or changing this one interaction. With this in mind we invested in creating North Star style concepts to help realize how Octopus could work holistically. We received positive feedback from our testing with customers and Devops professionals on our concept. However, it would be a big change and the path to achieve this isn’t so simple.  Also, we needed improvements to the underlying systems in place to support quality cross cutting UI changes.

## Under the Covers

Design System. Design System. Design System. But first design tokens. We started by tackling our simplest design decisions first. This is primarily our colors and typography. Some of you may have already noticed but we darken our dark mode. This was the result of taming and consolidating the many colors that had grown overtime. Yes, UX debt is a thing. Our team now uses color scales that lead to consistent use of color. Also, meeting contrast accessibility guidelines becomes easier. After updating our colors and integrating our design tokens we moved onto understanding what good quality components look like starting with our navigation. 

## Upcoming changes

To continue bringing a modern UI across Octopus Deploy we are tackling the Page header section. and moving down the page to our page headers, breadcrumbs. This is creating a simpler layout to support easier navigation between areas of the app. With each change applied to the navigation it will bring more visual consistency and correction of the information architecture.



Octopus is dedicated to improving its user experience. This is the first of many milestones ahead of us to achieve our North Star navigation experience.
