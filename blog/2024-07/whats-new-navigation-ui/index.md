Our new navigation UI, rolling out to Cloud customers in July, makes it easier to find what you're looking for in Octopus in a handful of different ways. It's also a faster experience for our scale customers. And for everyone, we've ensured modern dark and light themes that are more considerate of accessibility.

In this post, I give you a quick rundown of the navigation UI changes.  

## Getting around‚Ä®
- Vertical navigation exposes the features you use to manage deployment projects

- Favorited projects appear in the navigation, simply by clicking the star ‚≠êÔ∏è 

- We've positioned global search more centrally

## Projects dashboard

- Faster loading ‚ö°Ô∏è

- Collapsible columns for better status visibility across complex projects

- Filters for easier configuration

## Modern theme‚Ä®
- We heard you ‚Äì dark mode and light mode stay true to their intended theme. 

- No more SHOUTY capitalized buttons or tabs üòå
