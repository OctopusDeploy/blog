Our New Navigation UI has a handful of different ways of making it easier to find what you are looking for. A faster experience for our scale customers. And for everyone, modern dark / light themes that are more considered of accessibility.

## Getting around 
→ Vertical Navigation exposes features used to manage deploy projects

→ Favourited projects appears in the navigation, simply clicking the star ⭐️ 

→ Global Search is positioned more centrally

→ No more SHOUTY capitalised buttons or tabs 😌
