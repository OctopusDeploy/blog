 In this episode, we cover the Script Console, disabling deployments of child projects, and common performance issues. You can find previous episodes and submit questions on our [Ask Octopus](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) page.

Here are the questions with direct links to where they start in the video:

- [Bob discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcPtD14f0_I&t=28s) "common uses for the Script Console."
- [Ryan answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcPtD14f0_I&t=8m17s) "how do I keep projects deployed as a group from being deployed separately?"
- [Derek discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcPtD14f0_I&t=16m20s) "common performance issues part 2."
