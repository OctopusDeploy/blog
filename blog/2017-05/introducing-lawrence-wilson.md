Hi, my name is Lawrence and I have just joined Octopus Deploy as an Infrastructure Engineer.

Before coming here, I worked at a startup designing and building the IT Infrastructure. During that time I have seen the Microsoft Azure platform grow from being the Service Manager up to what we see now in Resource Manager. I am passionate about authoring Azure ARM Templates, working with Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

The most satisfying thing to me is being able to learn and grow in order to solve problems that seem chalanging at first until they are broken down and fixed. 

I live in Melbourne, there's a lake here that I like to jog around - when the weather permits, that is - and if it's raining I go to the gym instead!

I am very excited to be a part of Octopus Deploy, learning and growing.
