Introductory paragraph that tells the reader why they should read on.

Tell them what the how to demonstrates, and when/why the user might find this useful.

## Body

Tell the reader what tech they need and anything else they **need** to know before you jump into the steps.

### Configure X

Break the steps the user needs to take into logical groups:

1. Step one.
1. Step two.
1. Step three.

Let the users know they're on the right track by telling them the outcome of the procedure they just completed. Include as many procedures as are necessary for the user to achieve the goal of the post, and try to avoid saying things like Configure X without providing the actual steps the users need to take.

Use screenshots to help orient the user if they're moving between screens/systems and/or if screenshots will provide additionally clarity (or they're cool and you want to show them off):

### Configure Y

1. Include as many procedures as necessary.
2. Use clear declarative language.
    1. Break steps into multiple nested parts so you're not asking the user to process too much all at once.

## Conclusion

Close off the post by restating the what was achieved in the how-to, share any closing thoughts, and invite feedback.
