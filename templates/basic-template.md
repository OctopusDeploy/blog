Introductory paragraph that tells the reader why they should read on.

## Body

The body of the post is where you share your hypothesis, how-to, or story.

### Subheadings

Use three ### to include H3 headings.

Use **Bold** text for UI labels, use single back-tics for `parameters` and `filepaths`, and three back-tics for code blocks:

```
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```

Use the following (minus the backtics) to include images:

```
![Alt text, a description of the image](/path/to/image.png "width=500")*Optional caption text*
```
If including images, please include alt text. Alt text is primarily used to describe images to people unable to see them, and can be 125 characters max including spaces. You can also include an image caption if the reader would benefit from additional information or context.
