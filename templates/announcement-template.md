State the subject of the announcement as plainly and directly as you can.

## Body

Body and Conclusion headings might be unnecessary for short posts.

If the announcement is likely to be controversial, acknowledge that and explain the reasons that helped inform the decision.

If including images, please include alt text. Alt text is primarily used to describe images to people unable to see them, and can be 125 characters max including spaces. You can also include an image caption if the reader would benefit from additional information or context.
Here's an example of authoring alt text and an image caption:
![Alt text](image.png)*Caption text*
