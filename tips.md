# Writing Tips

The Octopus blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that intersect with the problems Octopus solves.

This page provides some tips for writing for the Octopus blog. Nothing on this page is absolute, it's not a style guide, and it will continue to grow over time.

## What to write

We have five main categories that we blog about:

- **Company**: Announcements about changes at Octopus.
- **Product**: Posts detailing new releases, features, the roadmap, RFCs, etc.
- **Engineering**: Posts about developer tools, programming, performance, and behind the scenes technical posts.
- **CI/CD and DevOps**: CI/CD, DevOps, and operations related posts.
- **Events and Webinars**: Information about events we're attending and webinars we're running.

## Principles

Writing is hard, and we all have different voices, but we want the experience of reading the blog to be consistent and useful. All of the posts are edited before they're published, but the following principles are designed to help guide the voice we use:

1. The posts we write are useful and informative to our target audience and demonstrate our domain expertise.

1. We're direct and honest, and we don't use hyperbole or marketing-speak.

    Our users are educated professionals, who prefer directness and honesty so they can decide for themselves if something is useful or interesting. They're (rightly) suspicious of anything that sounds like marketing-speak, and they want to know the details. We don't use hyperbole or try to hoodwink people into reading on. This applies throughout every post, but clearly explaining the topic in the opening sentences lets readers decide if they care enough to read on. Even if one topic doesn't appeal to them, by not wasting their time, they're more likely to read on the next time they see a post from us that does appeal, however, if we did waste their time, it's unlikely they'd return at all.

1. The posts we write have well-defined topics.

    After reading one of our posts, we want our readers to feel like they learned something useful. Our posts help readers solve specific problems, tell a story, or otherwise inform them. The better you define your topic and the problem you want to solve before you start writing, the better the chances are your post will be useful, direct, and informative. Having a well-defined topic helps keep us on a direct path from Problem to Solution without wandering off into side stories or anecdotes that don't directly support the solution being presented.

1. We're clear and concise.

    We remove the obstacles between the reader and our meaning. This means editing out unnecessary sentences, clauses, and words that don't directly convey meaning. Often the topics we write about are complicated, and the potential for confusion is high; because of this, we opt for simple sentence structures that don't place additional cognitive load on the reader.

    For instance, the first sentence in this section originally read:

    > We try to remove as many of the obstacles between the reader and their understanding as we can.

    I revised it to:

    > We remove the obstacles between the reader and our meaning.

    There are fewer words to process and trip over in the second version.

    Being clear and concise in a first draft is difficult, so sometimes it's best to get the first draft down, and then go back through the text and delete anything that can be deleted.

    A simple rule here is:

    > If something can be deleted without altering the meaning or tone of the text, it probably should be deleted.

1. We structure posts logically so they are easy to follow.

    We want our audience to read our posts straight through without needing to go back or read ahead to understand the current point. This can be more work for us, but by structuring our posts in a logical way we're not asking more of our readers.

    Similar to being clear and concise, it's not always possible to structure posts in a logical way during the first draft, but that's okay, after all it's only the first draft. If you enjoy working from an outline that can help, but whether you outline or not, it's worth taking a look at the finished draft to see if you're asking readers to jump back and forth in the post. If you are, there's a good chance you need to restructure the post so that things are presented in the order the reader needs to know them.

    Just as the entire post should be structured logically, so should the individual sentences in the post. For instance:

    > Select option A from the User Preferences screen after you've logged into the portal.

    The above example presents the information in the opposite order the user needs it. Option A is the ultimate goal and so perhaps the most important thing, but the sentence should be changed to guide the user through the process they need to follow without having to read the sentence backward:

    > After you've logged into the portal, click the User Preferences tab, and select option A.

    A common structure for our posts looks like this:

    **Introduction**: We state what we're going to talk about and why it's useful. Sometimes it's a good idea to write this after you've written the rest of the post when your confidence about what you're *going* to say is at its highest.

    **Body**: The body of the post is where you share your hypothesis, how to, or story. If you're writing a how to post, this is where you explain the steps the reader needs to follow, if you're explaining a change we're making to the product, this is where you state the decision we've made, explain the reasons for the decision, and tell the reader what to expect next.

    **Conclusion**: Close off the post by restating the main points of the post, share any closing thoughts, and invite feedback.

1. We're writing for an international audience.

    Our customers are everywhere. Some of them are native English speakers, but many of them are not. We avoid colloquialisms that would likely confuse them, and we use US English.

1. We're not Octo-obsessed.

    Octopus isn't the only thing we write about. We love Octopus, and we hope our users do too, but Octopus isn't the only tool that can solve our users' problems, and sometimes, it's not even the right tool, but that shouldn't stop us sharing useful content with our users.

## Self editing

All the posts are edited before we publish them, but the following tips will help you get your post in the best possible shape.

1. Done doesn't mean deployed when it comes to your first draft.

   The first draft is typically where you'll explore your ideas and make your points. The second and third drafts are where you refine your points and craft a post that people will enjoy reading. Give yourself some time between drafts so that content feels fresh when you return it.

1. Turn on your spell checker.

   Typos happen to the best of us, but there's a direct correlation between the number of silly mistakes in a post and the restraint the editor will exercise when going through the rest of the post. If typos slip through into the final copy, they do impact the reader's confidence in the content and the people who published it.

   We have a corporate Grammarly account (details are with the software policies). Grammarly isn't always right, but its suggestions are right more than they're wrong so it is a good idea to run your post through Grammarly.

1. White space is your friend.

   Dense paragraph after dense paragraph of text is intimidating and will put readers off. Try to break up big paragraphs by grouping similar thoughts into smaller paragraphs, if you're listing options or documenting steps use bullet points or numbered lists instead.

   More white space makes text more approachable.

1. Replace ambiguity with specificity.

   As an expert on your topic it can be easy to forget what you didn't know before you became an expert, which can lead to making assumptions about what your audience knows. Don't feel like you have to explain every possible aspect of your topic or provide in-depth background knowledge for every post, but do try to be specific in your writing to make it easy for non-experts to follow along.

   When you review your post look for words like: it, they, them, and those, and if there's a chance the reader might be confused by which it, they, them, or those you're referring to be more specific so there's no doubt.

1. Use text-to-speech

   Use text-to-speech software to listen to your post. When we read our own text we tend to read what we think we wrote as opposed to what we actually wrote (this is why typos are so persistent). Having the computer read the text makes typos and other mistakes we'd otherwise miss stand out.

1. Review the edits

    Your post will be edited before it goes live. We're aiming for a consistent voice and tone with all the blog posts so some of the edits will likely be for consistency with other posts.

    Review the changes that are made, and if you notice any recurring patterns to the edits take note as this will help avoid similar edits in the future. If you're uncertain about why some edits have been made, or you disagree with the edits, ping the person who made the edits to discuss the changes. The editing process is designed to make the posts read as well as they can, but we don't want that to alter your meaning or make you feel like you're being made to something you didn't mean.
