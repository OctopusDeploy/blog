## Welcome

Well done, you deployed your first application with Octopus Deploy!

This overview provides some additional context and information about Octopus Deploy. It also points you in the right direction to learn more.

## What is Octopus Deploy and who is it for?

Octopus Deploy was founded in 2012, to simplify the hardest parts of continuous delivery and operations processes. We create happy deployments, and by extension, happy software teams.

Octopus focuses on three main parts of continuous delivery: 

- Deploy
- Release
- Operate

Octopus sits in the middle of the CI/CD toolchain, acting as an orchestrator. This orchestration requires several software integrations from coding frameworks to cloud providers. We choose to do a smaller number of things at high quality, over doing everything.

By focusing on orchestration and enabling these integrations, Octopus provides best-in-class tooling.

See our custom tutorial builder that builds [tutorials for your CI/CD stack.](https://octopus.com/docs/guides)

## What have I learned?

You imported an exported project and deployed a package to an Azure web application, which is a great achievement. This also taught you some of the fundamental concepts of Octopus Deploy:

 - Deployment targets
 - Environments
 - Accounts
 - Packaging applications
 - Projects
 - Releases
 - Deployments

The post you worked through was a simple example. Production level solutions are typically more complex though, with multiple deployment steps and deployment targets. There are other advanced Octopus Deploy features that developers can use. These include tenants, the Octopus REST API, and more. To learn about these, you can read our comprehensive [documentation of all the Octopus Deploy features](https://octopus.com/docs).

## Where can I learn more?

Octopus Deploy is a product that sits between several other third-party tools. This requires knowledge of those tools and how they integrate with Octopus. Resources to learn more about how Octopus works are available below.

We run webinars that cover both fundamental and advanced topics. Octopus integrates with several cloud service providers and tools, and often our webinars hosted by Octopus and another CI/CD software tool provider.

For new users, this Octopus 101 webinar is a great place to start:
