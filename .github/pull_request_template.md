# Prerequisites

- [ ] The draft is complete and this post is ready to be reviewed.
- [ ] I'm familiar with the [writing for Octopus TL;DR](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/901d2a-blog-content).
- [ ] The PR build passes validation, and if it doesn't, I've checked the [common validations errors](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/901d2a-blog-content/t/817249) and none of those apply.
- [ ] The images I've included follow the [rules for working with images](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/5061d7-working-with-images).
- [ ] I've added alt text for all the images I've included (alt text describes image to people unable to see it, 125 characters max)
- [ ] One screenshot (if any are included) is suitable for Twitter. This screenshot should be 16:9 ratio and at least 1200 x 675 pixels. For screenshots from the Octopus Web Portal, please use Chrome and the browserâ€™s zoom function to remove as much white space as possible. If screenshots are annotated (e.g., with boxes or arrows), please also provide a version that is unannotated for use on Twitter. Do not use dark mode for the Octopus Web Portal.
- [ ] I've drafted social media posts for Twitter and LinkedIn.
- [ ] I've dropped a note in Slack in #topic-content-marketing to let Tegan Ali know my post is ready for review.
