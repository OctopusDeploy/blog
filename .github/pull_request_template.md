# Pre-requisites

- [ ] The draft is complete and this post is ready to be reviewed.
- [ ] I'm familiar with the [writing for Octopus TL;DR](https://www.octopus.design/writing/writing-tldr/).
- [ ] The PR build passes validation, and if it doesn't, I've checked the [common validations errors](https://style.octopus.com/writing-at-octopus-tldr#common-validation-errors) and none of those apply.
- [ ] The images I've included follow the [rules for working with images](https://www.octopus.design/writing/working-with-images/).
- [ ] I've added alt text for all the images I've included (alt text describes image to people unable to see it, 125 characters max)
- [ ] One screenshot (if any are included) is suitable for Twitter. This screenshot should be 16:9 ratio and at least 1200 x 675 pixels. For screenshots from the Octopus web app, please use Chrome and the browserâ€™s zoom function to remove as much white space as possible. If screenshots are annotated (e.g., with boxes or arrows), please also provide a version that is unannotated for use on Twitter.
