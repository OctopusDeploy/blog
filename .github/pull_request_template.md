# Prerequisites

- [ ] The draft is complete and this post is ready to be reviewed.
- [ ] I'm familiar with the [guide for blog content basics](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/901d2a-blog-content).
- [ ] I've checked the content using Grammarly and the [Hemingway app](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to remove typos, grammatical errors, and passive voice. 
- [ ] The PR build passes validation, and if it doesn't, I've checked the [common validations errors](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/901d2a-blog-content/t/817249) and none of those apply.
- [ ] The images I've included follow the [rules for working with images](https://www.octopus.design/932c0f1a9/p/5061d7-working-with-images).
- [ ] I've added alt text for all the images I've included (alt text describes image to people unable to see it, 125 characters max)
- [ ] I've drafted social media posts for Twitter and LinkedIn and will post them for review in #topic-social-media.
- [ ] I've dropped a note in Slack in #topic-content-marketing to let Tegan Ali know my post is ready for review. (No need to fill out a content brief.)
